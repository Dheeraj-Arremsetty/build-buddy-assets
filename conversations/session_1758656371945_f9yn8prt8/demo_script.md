### **Demo Presentation Script: The AI-Powered Onboarding Concierge with IBM watsonx Orchestrate**

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Demo Specialist Name]
**Audience:** HR, IT, and Business Line Leaders
**Total Time:** 20 Minutes

---

### **Section 1: The Modern Onboarding Challenge (Time: 2 minutes)**

**(0:00 - 2:00)**

**[PRESENTER ON CAMERA/STAGE - OPENING SLIDE: "Transforming Employee Onboarding with Agentic AI"]**

**Talking Points:**

"Good morning. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with IBM watsonx. We're here today to talk about a business process that every single company experiences, but very few have perfected: employee onboarding.

Think about the last time you onboarded a new hire. It’s a flurry of activity, a complex dance between multiple departments.
*   **HR** needs to create a profile, send welcome packets, and handle compliance.
*   **IT** has to provision accounts, order laptops, and grant system access.
*   **Learning & Development** needs to enroll them in training and schedule introductory meetings.

This process is often manual, disjointed, and prone to error. The result? A frustrating experience for the new hire, delayed productivity, and a significant administrative burden on your teams. In today's competitive talent market, that first impression is critical. A clunky onboarding process can impact retention before an employee has even written their first line of code or spoken to their first customer."

**Key Message:**

"The core challenge isn't a lack of tools; it's a lack of **orchestration**. The process is fragmented across different systems and teams. This is precisely the kind of complex, high-value problem IBM is solving with our strategy in enterprise-grade AI. We believe the future of work isn't just about individual AI assistants, but about building teams of specialized AI agents that can automate and orchestrate entire business workflows from end to end."

### **Section 2: The Solution - Agentic Orchestration with watsonx Orchestrate (Time: 2 minutes)**

**(2:00 - 4:00)**

**[SLIDE: Diagram showing a Supervisor Agent ("Onboarding Concierge") delegating tasks to three Collaborator Agents (HR, IT, L&D)]**

**Talking Points:**

"To solve this, we've built an **AI-Powered Onboarding Concierge** using IBM watsonx Orchestrate.

Think of this not as a single AI, but as a digital manager. We have a supervisor agent, the `Onboarding Concierge`, whose only job is to understand a complex request and delegate tasks to its team of specialists.

*   It has an **`HR_Specialist_Agent`** that knows how to interact with your core HR systems.
*   It has an **`IT_Support_Agent`** that can create tickets in ServiceNow and provision accounts in Active Directory.
*   And it has an **`LD_Coordinator_Agent`** that can manage your learning platform and schedule meetings in Outlook.

This multi-agent approach is what we call **Agentic Orchestration**. It allows you to build powerful, resilient, and scalable automations by breaking down a massive process into manageable, specialized tasks.

Furthermore, our concierge is connected to a **Knowledge Base** containing your company documents—like the employee handbook and IT policies. This means it can not only *do* things but also *answer* questions, providing immediate support to your new hires."

**Value Proposition:**

"The value is clear: We're moving from simple task automation to **end-to-end process orchestration**. This means reducing administrative overhead by up to 50%, accelerating new hire time-to-productivity, and delivering a world-class, seamless onboarding experience from day one."

### **Section 3: Live Demo - The Onboarding Concierge in Action (Time: 7 minutes)**

**(4:00 - 11:00)**

**[PRESENTER SWITCHES TO LIVE DEMO VIEW - A COMMAND LINE INTERFACE OR A SIMPLE WEB CHAT UI]**

"Now, let's see this in action. I'm going to interact with our `Onboarding_Concierge_Agent` directly from the command line, just as a developer or an HR operator might.

`orchestrate chat start --agent Onboarding_Concierge_Agent`

The agent is ready. Let's start the process."

#### **Demo Scenario 1: End-to-End Onboarding Orchestration (4 minutes)**

**Presenter Action:** Type the following prompt into the chat interface.

> **"Onboard our new hire, Jane Doe, as a Senior Developer starting next Monday. Her manager is John Smith."**

**Talking Points (as the agent processes):**

"I've given the concierge a simple, natural language request. Watch what happens.

1.  **Delegation to HR:** The first thing it does is recognize the need for an official employee record. It invokes the `HR_Specialist_Agent`. **[Point to screen output]** You can see the HR agent's tool, `create_hr_profile`, has run successfully. We now have a unique Employee ID: `EMP98765`. It then immediately sends the digital welcome packet. The HR part is done.

2.  **Delegation to IT:** Now, with the Employee ID, the concierge intelligently moves to the next step. It calls the `IT_Support_Agent`. **[Point to screen output]** The IT agent's tools are now running. It's creating user accounts and, because Jane is a 'Developer', it correctly selected the 'Developer' hardware package. We have a ServiceNow ticket number, `SNOW-TKT789`, for tracking the equipment shipment.

3.  **Delegation to L&D:** Finally, the concierge invokes the `LD_Coordinator_Agent`. **[Point to screen output]** This agent enrolls Jane in mandatory training, including a specialized 'Secure Coding Practices' course because of her role. It has also scheduled her introductory meetings for next week.

4.  **Final Summary:** And here is the final, consolidated summary from the concierge. In under a minute, we've executed a complex, multi-departmental workflow that would typically take hours, if not days, of manual coordination."

#### **Demo Scenario 2: Knowledge Base Q&A (RAG) (2 minutes)**

**Presenter Action:** Type a new, unrelated question.

> **"What is the company's policy on work-from-home days?"**

**Talking Points:**

"But what about the new hire's experience? Jane will have questions. Let's see how the concierge handles them.

Notice what the agent does here. It recognizes this isn't a task to be delegated. Instead, it queries its knowledge base, which contains the `Employee_Handbook.pdf`. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, it finds the relevant section and synthesizes a direct, accurate answer.

**[Read the agent's response from the screen]** 'Our company supports a flexible hybrid work model. Employees are generally expected to be in the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays...'

This provides instant, 24/7 support for your new hires, freeing up your HR team from answering repetitive questions."

#### **Demo Scenario 3: Human-in-the-Loop Status Check (1 minute)**

**Presenter Action:** Type a follow-up question.

> **"What is the status of Jane Doe's onboarding?"**

**Talking Points:**

"Finally, the system maintains context. An HR manager can check in at any time. The agent remembers the previous steps and provides a clear, concise status update based on the completed actions. This demonstrates how humans can remain in the loop, supervising and interacting with these AI workflows naturally."

### **Section 4: Under the Hood - How We Built This with the ADK (Time: 2.5 minutes)**

**(11:00 - 13:30)**

**[SWITCH BACK TO SLIDES. SHOW A SNIPPET OF THE `Onboarding_Concierge_Agent.yaml` FILE]**

**Talking Points:**

"What you just saw looks like magic, but we've made it incredibly straightforward for your development teams to build. This entire solution was created using our **Agent Development Kit, or ADK**.

This is the YAML configuration for our supervisor agent. It’s simple and declarative.
*   **`collaborators`**: Here, we simply list the names of the specialist agents it can delegate to. This is how we build the team.
*   **`knowledge_base`**: We point it to our `onboarding_knowledge_base`, instantly giving it the ability to answer questions.
*   **`instructions`**: This is the most critical part. We provide simple, English-language instructions that guide the agent's reasoning. We tell it the *sequence* of operations: first HR, then IT, then L&D. This ensures the process runs correctly every time.

**[SHOW A SNIPPET OF THE `it_tools.py` PYTHON FILE]**

And the actions themselves? They are just Python functions. By adding a simple `@tool` decorator and a clear docstring, our ADK automatically makes this function available to an agent. This `order_equipment` function could contain an API call to your real ServiceNow instance. This is how we bridge the gap between the AI and your existing enterprise systems."

**Key Message:**

"watsonx Orchestrate provides a powerful, yet accessible framework for builders. You don't need to be a data scientist to build sophisticated, multi-agent orchestrations that connect directly to your business's core systems."

### **Section 5: Business Value and Competitive Differentiation (Time: 2.5 minutes)**

**(13:30 - 16:00)**

**[SLIDE: "Tangible Business Outcomes"]**

**Talking Points:**

"So let's bring this back to business value. What does the Onboarding Concierge deliver?

*   **Drastic Efficiency Gains:** We automate dozens of manual tasks, reducing administrative overhead and freeing your HR and IT teams to focus on strategic work.
*   **Accelerated Productivity:** New hires get everything they need—accounts, equipment, training—on or before day one. They become productive faster.
*   **Enhanced Employee Experience:** A smooth, modern, and responsive onboarding process creates a fantastic first impression, boosting engagement and retention.
*   **Improved Compliance & Consistency:** The process is executed perfectly every time, ensuring all compliance and training steps are completed without fail.

**[SLIDE: "The IBM Difference: Enterprise-Ready AI"]**

How is this different from other AI solutions in the market?

*   Unlike generic AI assistants like **Microsoft Copilot** that are embedded in productivity tools, our approach is about orchestrating core business processes across systems. We build digital workers, not just helpers.
*   Unlike raw cloud platforms from **AWS or Google**, which give you the basic building blocks, IBM provides a governed, enterprise-ready platform with the ADK to rapidly build, deploy, and manage these agentic solutions.
*   And unlike a pure consulting approach, we empower you with the platform and tools to build and adapt these solutions yourselves.

Our focus is on delivering **governed, trustworthy, and scalable AI** that solves specific, high-impact business challenges."

### **Section 6: Q&A and Next Steps (Time: 4 minutes)**

**(16:00 - 20:00)**

**[PRESENTER ON CAMERA/STAGE - Q&A SLIDE]**

"Thank you. I'd now like to open it up for any questions you may have."

**Prepared Q&A (Anticipated Questions):**

*   **Q: How does this connect to our real systems like Workday, SAP, or ServiceNow?**
    *   **A:** Great question. The Python tools we showed are the integration points. Instead of the mock data you saw, your developers would simply insert the API calls to your actual systems. watsonx Orchestrate handles the secure credential management to ensure those connections are safe.

*   **Q: How do we ensure the AI is secure and our proprietary data is safe?**
    *   **A:** This is central to IBM's strategy. The entire watsonx platform is built for the enterprise. Your data is your data. The models can be run in our secure cloud, your own cloud, or even on-premise. We provide robust governance tools to control access, manage prompts, and ensure the AI operates within your defined guardrails.

*   **Q: This seems complex. What kind of team do we need to build and maintain this?**
    *   **A:** While the outcome is sophisticated, the building process is designed for enterprise developers. If you have teams that are comfortable with Python and APIs, they can be highly effective with our Agent Development Kit. You don't need a large team of specialized AI researchers.

**Next Steps & Call to Action:**

"The onboarding process is just one example. This same agentic framework can be applied to sales order processing, IT incident resolution, financial reporting—any complex process that spans multiple systems and teams.

Our recommended next step is a **Discovery Workshop**. We can work with you to identify the top 1-3 high-value use cases within your organization and map out a proof-of-concept, just like the one you saw today.

Thank you for your time."
