## IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: Intelligent P2P Automation for Xerox

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Demo Specialist Name]
**Audience:** Xerox Digital Transformation & AI Strategy Team
**Duration:** 20 minutes

### **Part 1: Setting the Stage (0:00 - 3:00)**

**[SHOW SLIDE 1: Title Slide - IBM watsonx Orchestrate & Xerox: From Task Automation to End-to-End Process Orchestration]**

**(0:00 - 1:30) Introduction & Acknowledging the Xerox Strategy**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. We've been following Xerox's strategic journey closely, and it's clear you're navigating a significant and impressive transformation—moving from a legacy leader in print to a forward-thinking digital and IT services partner."
*   "Your research report highlights a key challenge: shifting market perception and replacing legacy revenue with new digital streams. We see your investments in areas like Intelligent Workplace Services and particularly your AI strategy with Xerox Agent Builder as central to this pivot."
*   "Agent Builder is a powerful tool. It's excellent at **task automation**—creating intelligent agents to handle specific, repetitive jobs like extracting data from a document. This is a critical first step for efficiency."
*   "But as you build more of these specialized agents, a new challenge emerges: How do you connect them? How do you make them work together with your existing enterprise systems, like your ERP, and your human experts to manage a complete, end-to-end business process?"

**[SHOW SLIDE 2: The Orchestration Gap]**
*A visual showing separate silos: Xerox Agent Builder, an ERP system (SAP logo), a communication tool (Slack logo), and a human worker. Arrows are missing between them.*

**(1:30 - 3:00) The Problem: The Orchestration Gap**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "This is what we call the 'Orchestration Gap.' You have powerful tools, but they often operate in their own lanes. A process like Procure-to-Pay doesn't live in one system. It starts with an invoice, maybe processed by a Xerox Agent. It needs validation against a Purchase Order in your ERP. If there's an issue, it needs to be routed to an Accounts Payable clerk for review, likely in a tool like Slack or Teams. Finally, it triggers a payment and gets archived."
*   "Stitching this together manually or with brittle, point-to-point code is slow, expensive, and creates more technical debt. It's the digital equivalent of passing a piece of paper from desk to desk."
*   **Key Message:** "The core business challenge isn't just automating individual tasks; it's about **orchestrating the entire sequence of tasks, decisions, and human interventions** that make up a valuable business process."

### **Part 2: The Solution - An Intelligent Automation Fabric (3:00 - 6:00)**

**[SHOW SLIDE 3: Introducing watsonx Orchestrate]**
*A visual showing Orchestrate as a central "Supervisor Agent" hub, with spokes connecting to the Xerox Agent, ERP, Slack, and the human worker from the previous slide.*

**(3:00 - 4:30) Solution Overview: watsonx Orchestrate**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "This is precisely where IBM watsonx Orchestrate comes in. It's not here to replace your Xerox Agent Builder. It's here to **empower and amplify it.**"
*   "Think of Orchestrate as the intelligent conductor for your digital workforce. Your Xerox Agent is a world-class violinist, fantastic at its specific job. Your ERP is the steady percussion section. Your AP team is the human expert who steps in when needed. Orchestrate is the conductor that reads the business process 'sheet music' and ensures everyone plays their part, in the right sequence, at the right time."
*   **Value Proposition:** "We provide an **intelligent automation fabric** that allows you to build a 'Supervisor Agent' in natural language. This Supervisor knows the end-to-end process and can delegate tasks to a team of specialized 'collaborator' agents—including your own Xerox agents, connectors to enterprise apps, and even custom-built tools."

**(4:30 - 6:00) The Demo Setup: Orchestrating Procure-to-Pay**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "Today, we're going to show you this in action with the Procure-to-Pay use case you defined. We've used our Agent Development Kit, or ADK, to build a solution that mirrors your exact process flow."
*   "We have a **P2P Supervisor Agent**. Its job is to manage the entire invoice lifecycle."
*   "It has three **collaborator agents** it can call upon:"
    1.  An **Invoice Data Agent**, which simulates your Xerox Agent Builder extracting data.
    2.  An **ERP Connector Agent**, which checks a mock ERP for PO and vendor data.
    3.  An **AP Action Agent**, which can send a Slack alert for exceptions or trigger a payment.
*   "Let's see how this Supervisor handles the complexities of a real-world P2P process."

### **Part 3: Live Demo (6:00 - 14:00)**

**[TRANSITION TO LIVE DEMO INTERFACE - ORCHESTRATE CHAT]**

**(6:00 - 8:30) Scenario 1: The "Happy Path" - Flawless Execution**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "Okay, we're in the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface. I'm going to act as an AP manager and ask our Supervisor Agent to process a new invoice. This first one, INV-1001, is a perfect match."
*   **Demo Step 1:** Type the prompt: `Process invoice INV-1001`
*   **[NARRATE THE ACTION]:** "Right now, the Supervisor is kicking off the workflow.
    *   First, it's invoking the **Invoice Data Agent** to extract the details: Global Tech Supplies, $4500.
    *   Next, it's passing that data to the **ERP Connector Agent**. This agent is performing two checks: Is 'Global Tech Supplies' an approved vendor? Yes. Does the $4500 on the invoice match the amount on Purchase Order PO-9501? Yes.
    *   Because everything validated perfectly, the Supervisor's instructions tell it to proceed. It's now calling the **AP Action Agent** to first trigger the payment, and then archive the invoice."
*   **Expected Outcome:** The chat responds with a success message like: "Invoice INV-1001 has been successfully processed and paid. The transaction ID is PAY-20250917215501. The invoice has been archived." The mock console output shows the payment and archival logs.
*   **Business Value:** "Notice what just happened. An entire multi-system process was completed in seconds, with zero human intervention, zero errors, and a full audit trail. This is the goal: straight-through processing for the 80% of invoices that are routine."

**(8:30 - 11:00) Scenario 2: Exception Handling - Data Mismatch**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "But we all know the real world is messy. What happens when the data doesn't match? Let's process INV-1002, which has a small but critical discrepancy."
*   **Demo Step 2:** Type the prompt: `Process invoice INV-1002`
*   **[NARRATE THE ACTION]:** "The process starts the same way. The Invoice Agent extracts the data: Office Solutions Inc., for $1250.75. The ERP agent checks the vendor, which is approved. But when it validates the PO, it finds a mismatch. The PO was only for $1200."
*   "Now, instead of failing or making an incorrect payment, the Supervisor follows its business logic for exceptions. It invokes the **AP Action Agent** with a specific task: notify the human team."
*   **Expected Outcome:** The chat responds: "I've detected a data mismatch for invoice INV-1002. The invoice amount is $1250.75, but the PO amount is $1200.00. I have sent a Slack alert to the #accounts-payable channel for manual review." The mock console output shows a formatted Slack message.
*   **Business Value:** "This is intelligent exception handling. We're not just automating the easy stuff; we're automating the *detection and routing* of problems. This frees your AP clerks from tedious validation to focus only on the exceptions that require their expertise. This is a perfect example of human-in-the-loop AI."

**(11:00 - 12:30) Scenario 3: Exception Handling - New Vendor & Policy Adherence**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "Let's try one more. INV-1003 is from a brand new vendor not yet in our system."
*   **Demo Step 3:** Type the prompt: `Process invoice INV-1003`
*   **[NARRATE THE ACTION]:** "The process begins, data is extracted. But this time, when the ERP agent checks the vendor 'Creative Design Co.', it reports back that the vendor is not found in the master list."
*   **Expected Outcome:** The chat responds immediately: "Processing for INV-1003 has been stopped. The vendor 'Creative Design Co.' is not an approved vendor. Please initiate the New Vendor Onboarding workflow as per company policy."
*   **Business Value:** "This demonstrates compliance and risk mitigation. The Supervisor is enforcing your business rules automatically, preventing a non-compliant payment before it can even be considered. This is critical for financial governance."

**(12:30 - 14:00) Bonus: RAG for In-Context Decision Support**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "Finally, Orchestrate isn't just about doing; it's also about knowing. We've connected our Supervisor to a knowledge base containing your corporate procurement policies. An AP clerk can ask questions in natural language."
*   **Demo Step 4:** Type the prompt: `What is the policy for handling new vendors?`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds with text retrieved directly from the PDF: "According to the Corporate Procurement Policy, invoices from new vendors must not be processed. Instead, initiate the New Vendor Onboarding Workflow by contacting the procurement department."
*   **Business Value:** "This is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in action. You're embedding your corporate knowledge directly into the automation workflow, providing instant, accurate policy guidance to your team and ensuring consistent decision-making."

### **Part 4: Technical Highlights & Business Impact (14:00 - 18:00)**

**[SHOW SLIDE 4: The ADK Advantage: Building with Speed and Control]**
*Show snippets of the YAML agent definition and the Python tool decorator.*

**(14:00 - 16:00) Under the Hood: The Agent Development Kit (ADK)**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "What we just showed you looks complex, but building it is remarkably straightforward with our Agent Development Kit. This isn't a black box."
*   "You define your agents in simple YAML files. Here you can see the `P2P_Supervisor_Agent.yaml` where we list its collaborators and, most importantly, provide its step-by-step `instructions` in plain English."
*   "The actions themselves are just Python functions. You can see our `trigger_payment` function here. We simply add a `@tool` decorator, and Orchestrate automatically makes it available to your agents. This means your developers can easily connect to any API or internal system, including wrapping your Xerox Agent Builder outputs."
*   **Technical Highlight:** "The power here is the **separation of concerns**. Your developers build reusable tools (the 'what'), and your business analysts or process owners can define and refine the orchestration logic in natural language (the 'how'), dramatically accelerating development and deployment."

**[SHOW SLIDE 5: Tangible Business Value & ROI]**

**(16:00 - 18:00) Business Value & ROI**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "Let's translate this demo into tangible business impact for Xerox."
*   **Accelerate Your Digital Pivot:** "By orchestrating services like your Agent Builder with core enterprise systems, you can deliver true end-to-end digital solutions to your clients, moving beyond task automation to full process transformation."
*   **Drastically Reduce Operating Costs:** "Automating the P2P lifecycle can reduce invoice processing costs by over 70%. We're eliminating manual data entry, reducing validation time, and freeing up your skilled AP team to focus on high-value activities."
*   **Improve Financial Governance & Compliance:** "Automated validation and policy enforcement minimizes the risk of duplicate payments, fraud, and non-compliant spending, strengthening your entire financial posture."
*   **Enhance Employee and Supplier Experience:** "Faster, more accurate payments lead to happier suppliers. And by removing tedious, repetitive work, you empower your employees to be more strategic, boosting morale and retention."

### **Part 5: Q&A and Next Steps (18:00 - 20:00)**

**[SHOW SLIDE 6: Q&A]**

**(18:00 - 20:00) Q&A and Call to Action**

*   **[SAY THIS]:** "I'll pause here and open it up for any questions you might have."

*   **Anticipated Q&A:**
    *   **Q: How is this different from our Xerox Agent Builder?**
        *   **A:** They are complementary. Agent Builder is excellent for the *task* of extracting data from a document. Orchestrate is the *process* layer that takes that data and decides what to do next—validate it, get an approval, route an exception. Orchestrate makes your Agent Builder more valuable by integrating it into the full business workflow.
    *   **Q: The demo used mock data. How does it connect to real systems like SAP or our document repository?**
        *   **A:** The Python tools we showed are the connection points. Our ADK allows your developers to write Python code that calls the real APIs for SAP, SharePoint, Slack, or any other system. The `trigger_payment` function, for example, would be a few lines of code that make a secure API call to your financial system.
    *   **Q: What is the learning curve for our developers to start using the ADK?**
        *   **A:** If your developers know Python and understand APIs, they can be productive with the ADK in a matter of hours. The framework is designed for simplicity. Defining agents in YAML and tools with a simple decorator is very intuitive, and our documentation includes tutorials for common scenarios.

*   **Call to Action:**
    *   **[SAY THIS]:** "Thank you again for your time. The clear next step is to apply this to your real-world environment. We'd like to propose a collaborative, hands-on workshop with your technical team."
    *   "In this workshop, we can take a real invoice process, connect to a sandbox version of your ERP, and build a working Proof of Concept together using the ADK. This will allow you to see the power of orchestration with your own systems and data."
    *   "Who would be the right person to coordinate scheduling that workshop?"
