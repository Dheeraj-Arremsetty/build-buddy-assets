## Execution Plan

# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: AI-Powered Financial Insights Pipeline

## 1. Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building and demonstrating an **AI-Powered Financial Insights Pipeline** for the client using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The solution directly addresses the client's core challenge of extracting timely and accurate insights from unstructured financial documents. By creating a multi-agent system, we will showcase how Orchestrate can automate complex analysis workflows, significantly accelerating time-to-insight, enhancing analyst productivity, and amplifying the value of the client's existing proprietary data models.

The demo will feature a `FinancialSupervisorAgent` that orchestrates a team of specialized collaborator agents to ingest, analyze, and enrich financial data. This plan covers the complete lifecycle: setting up the project, creating mock data, defining tools in both Python and OpenAPI, configuring all agents via YAML, importing them using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) CLI, and verifying the solution through three targeted demo scenarios.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure the following are set up and configured:

*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit must be installed and configured for your environment. Refer to the official documentation for [Installing the watsonx Orchestrate ADK](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/getting_started/installing).
*   **Python Environment**: A working Python environment (3.9+) is required to create custom tools.
*   **Required Python Packages**: Install the necessary libraries for the Python tools. Create a `requirements.txt` file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: An active watsonx Orchestrate environment must be initialized using the ADK CLI (`orchestrate env init`).

### `requirements.txt`
Create this file in your project's root directory. The `requests` library will be used by our Python tools.

```text
# requirements.txt
requests
```

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Project Setup and Mock Data Creation

First, organize your project with a clear directory structure. This structure separates agents, tools, knowledge base documents, and mock data, making the project manageable and scalable.

**A. Create Project Directory Structure:**

```bash
mkdir financial_insights_demo
cd financial_insights_demo
mkdir agents tools kb mock_data
```

**B. Create Mock Data Files:**

These files simulate the real-world data sources your agents will interact with during the demo.

1.  **Mock Earnings Call Transcript:** This file represents the output of a transcription service or a raw document that needs analysis.

    *File: `mock_data/QuantumChip_earnings_transcript.txt`*
    ```text
    QuantumChip Inc. Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript

    Operator: Good afternoon. Welcome to the QuantumChip Inc. Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

    CEO: Thank you. We delivered strong results this quarter despite some emerging challenges. Our new Quantum Fusion processor is seeing unprecedented demand. However, we are actively monitoring significant supply chain disruptions in Southeast Asia which are impacting our logistics network. These geopolitical headwinds are a primary concern for the next two quarters.

    CFO: From a financial perspective, R&D spending was up 15% year-over-year, fueling our next-generation product pipeline. While we are confident in our long-term strategy, the aforementioned increased logistics costs have put pressure on our gross margins, which we are managing through operational efficiencies. We have identified these supply chain issues as a key risk factor in our internal modeling.
    ```

2.  **Mock Industry Reports (for Knowledge Base):** These PDF documents will be used to demonstrate the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of the supervisor agent. *For this plan, we will create placeholder text files that you should convert to PDF format using any standard tool.*

    *File: `mock_data/Gartner_Semiconductor_Outlook_2024.txt` (Convert to PDF)*
    ```text
    Gartner Global Semiconductor Outlook 2024

    The global semiconductor industry faces a complex landscape in 2024. Key risk factors include geopolitical tensions affecting material sourcing, particularly for rare earth metals. Furthermore, global supply chain resilience remains a top concern for major manufacturers, with many diversifying their fabrication and packaging locations to mitigate regional disruptions. Market trends indicate a strong shift towards specialized AI accelerator chips.
    ```

    *File: `mock_data/Industry_Analysis_Supply_Chain.txt` (Convert to PDF)*
    ```text
    Semiconductor Supply Chain Analysis Report

    This report analyzes the vulnerabilities in the modern semiconductor supply chain. Single-source dependency for key chemicals and substrates is a major risk. Logistics and transportation bottlenecks, as seen in recent years, can cause significant production delays. The report recommends investing in multi-sourcing strategies and near-shoring initiatives to build a more robust supply network.
    ```

### Step 2: Implement the Knowledge Base

The knowledge base will enable the `FinancialSupervisorAgent` to answer general industry questions, demonstrating its RAG capabilities as outlined in Demo Scenario 2.

**A. Explanation:**

We will create a built-in Milvus knowledge base using the ADK. This knowledge base will ingest the two mock PDF reports. When a user asks a general question, the supervisor agent's instructions will guide it to query this knowledge base to provide a grounded, accurate answer based on the document contents.

**B. Configuration File:**

*File: `kb/semiconductor_kb.yaml`*
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: knowledge_base
name: semiconductor_industry_kb
description: >
  Contains expert reports and analysis on the global semiconductor industry, including market trends, key players, and common risk factors like supply chain vulnerabilities and geopolitical tensions.
documents:
  - "mock_data/Gartner_Semiconductor_Outlook_2024.pdf"
  - "mock_data/Industry_Analysis_Supply_Chain.pdf"
vector_index:
  embeddings_model_name: ibm/slate-125m-english-rtrvr-v2
```

**C. Import Command:**

Run the following command from your project root directory to import the knowledge base into watsonx Orchestrate.

```bash
orchestrate knowledge-bases import -f kb/semiconductor_kb.yaml
```

### Step 3: Implement the Agent Tools

Here we will create the Python and OpenAPI tools that empower the specialized collaborator agents. Each tool is designed to perform a discrete task in the analysis pipeline.

#### A. DocumentIngestionAgent Tools (Python)

**Explanation:**
These tools are responsible for sourcing financial documents. `fetch_sec_filing` simulates retrieving a document like a 10-K or an earnings transcript from a source like EDGAR. `transcribe_earnings_call` simulates processing an audio file and returning its text content. For the demo, both will read from our mock text file to provide consistent input for the pipeline.

*File: `tools/ingestion_tools.py`*
```python
import json
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="fetch_sec_filing", description="Fetches the content of a public SEC filing or earnings call transcript for a given company ticker.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_sec_filing(company_ticker: str) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves the full text content of the latest financial filing for a company.

    Args:
        company_ticker (str): The stock ticker symbol for the company (e.g., 'QCI' for QuantumChip Inc.).

    Returns:
        str: The full text content of the document.
    """
    if company_ticker.upper() == "QCI":
        try:
            with open('mock_data/QuantumChip_earnings_transcript.txt', 'r') as f:
                return f.read()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return "Error: Mock data file not found for QCI."
    return f"Error: No document found for ticker {company_ticker}."

@tool(name="transcribe_earnings_call", description="Transcribes the audio of a company's earnings call from a provided source URL.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def transcribe_earnings_call(company_ticker: str, audio_source_url: str) -> str:
    """
    Processes an audio source and returns the transcribed text of an earnings call.

    Args:
        company_ticker (str): The stock ticker symbol of the company.
        audio_source_url (str): The URL to the audio recording of the earnings call.

    Returns:
        str: The transcribed text of the earnings call.
    """
    # In a real implementation, this would call a speech-to-text service.
    # For the demo, we return the same mock data.
    print(f"Simulating transcription for {company_ticker} from {audio_source_url}...")
    if company_ticker.upper() == "QCI":
        try:
            with open('mock_data/QuantumChip_earnings_transcript.txt', 'r') as f:
                return f.read()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return "Error: Mock data file not found for QCI."
    return f"Error: Transcription failed for ticker {company_ticker}."
```

#### B. NLPAnalysisAgent Tools (Python)

**Explanation:**
These tools perform deep textual analysis. `identify_risk_mentions` scans the text for specific keywords related to financial, operational, or geopolitical risks. `analyze_sentiment_by_section` breaks the document into logical parts (e.g., CEO, CFO statements) and assigns a sentiment score, providing nuanced insight. `extract_key_topics` identifies the main themes discussed in the document.

*File: `tools/nlp_tools.py`*
```python
import json
from typing import List, Dict
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="identify_risk_mentions", description="Identifies and extracts explicit mentions of risks from a financial document.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def identify_risk_mentions(document_content: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Scans document text to find sentences mentioning potential risks.

    Args:
        document_content (str): The text content of the financial document.

    Returns:
        List[Dict]: A list of dictionaries, each containing a risk type and the sentence where it was mentioned.
    """
    risks = []
    risk_keywords = {
        "SUPPLY_CHAIN": ["supply chain", "logistics"],
        "GEOPOLITICAL": ["geopolitical headwinds"],
        "MARGIN_PRESSURE": ["gross margins", "costs"]
    }
    sentences = document_content.split('.')
    for sentence in sentences:
        for risk_type, keywords in risk_keywords.items():
            for keyword in keywords:
                if keyword in sentence.lower():
                    risks.append({
                        "risk_type": risk_type,
                        "mention": sentence.strip()
                    })
    return risks

@tool(name="analyze_sentiment_by_section", description="Analyzes and scores the sentiment of different sections of a document.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def analyze_sentiment_by_section(document_content: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Analyzes the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of key sections like CEO and CFO statements.

    Args:
        document_content (str): The text content of the financial document.

    Returns:
        Dict: A dictionary with sections as keys and sentiment scores as values.
    """
    sentiment_data = {
        "CEO_Statement": {"sentiment": "Neutral", "score": 0.1, "summary": "CEO highlights strong demand but notes emerging supply chain challenges."},
        "CFO_Statement": {"sentiment": "Slightly Negative", "score": -0.3, "summary": "CFO discusses increased R&D spending but expresses concern over margin pressure from logistics costs."}
    }
    # This is a mock analysis. A real tool would use an NLP model.
    if "geopolitical headwinds" in document_content and "pressure on our gross margins" in document_content:
        return sentiment_data
    else:
        return {"Overall": {"sentiment": "Positive", "score": 0.8, "summary": "No significant negative indicators found."}}

@tool(name="extract_key_topics", description="Extracts the main financial and operational topics from a document.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def extract_key_topics(document_content: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Identifies the primary topics discussed in the text.

    Args:
        document_content (str): The text content of the financial document.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of key topics identified.
    """
    topics = []
    if "Quantum Fusion processor" in document_content:
        topics.append("New Product Demand")
    if "supply chain disruptions" in document_content:
        topics.append("Supply Chain Issues")
    if "R&D spending" in document_content:
        topics.append("R&D Investment")
    if "gross margins" in document_content:
        topics.append("Margin Pressure")
    return topics if topics else ["General Business Update"]
```

#### C. DataLinkerAgent Tools (OpenAPI)

**Explanation:**
This toolset demonstrates how watsonx Orchestrate can securely connect to the client's existing, proprietary internal APIs without modification. We define a simple OpenAPI specification for a mock API that provides internal risk scores and links to financial models. This is a powerful pattern for leveraging and extending the value of legacy systems.

*File: `tools/datalinker_api.yaml`*
```yaml

                relevance_score: 0.92
                status: "LINK_SUCCESSFUL"
```

#### D. Import All Tools

Run these commands from your project root to import all the tools you've defined into watsonx Orchestrate.

```bash
# Import Python-based tools
orchestrate tools import -f tools/ingestion_tools.py
orchestrate tools import -f tools/nlp_tools.py

# Import OpenAPI-based tools
orchestrate tools import -f tools/datalinker_api.yaml
```

### Step 4: Define the Agent Configurations (YAML)

Now, we define the agents themselves. The collaborator agents are simple wrappers around their tools, while the supervisor agent contains the complex logic for orchestrating the entire workflow.

#### A. Collaborator Agent Definitions

*File: `agents/DocumentIngestionAgent.yaml`*
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: DocumentIngestionAgent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  An agent specialized in sourcing and ingesting financial documents. Use this agent to retrieve SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, or transcribe audio from calls for a specific company.
instructions: >
  Your sole purpose is to retrieve document content.
  - If asked for a filing or transcript, use the 'fetch_sec_filing' tool.
  - If asked to transcribe an audio source, use the 'transcribe_earnings_call' tool.
  - Pass the retrieved text content back to the supervisor.
tools:
  - fetch_sec_filing
  - transcribe_earnings_call
```

*File: `agents/NLPAnalysisAgent.yaml`*
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: NLPAnalysisAgent
llm: watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-2-90b-vision-instruct
style: default
description: >
  An expert NLP agent for deep textual analysis of financial documents. It can identify key topics, analyze sentiment by section, and extract specific mentions of various risk types (supply chain, geopolitical, etc.).
instructions: >
  You are an expert financial text analyst.
  - Use 'identify_risk_mentions' to find specific risk-related sentences.
  - Use 'analyze_sentiment_by_section' to understand the tone of different speakers.
  - Use 'extract_key_topics' to summarize the main points.
  - Return the structured analysis results clearly.
tools:
  - identify_risk_mentions
  - analyze_sentiment_by_section
  - extract_key_topics
```

*File: `agents/DataLinkerAgent.yaml`*
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: DataLinkerAgent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  An agent that connects insights from documents to the client's proprietary internal data systems and models. Use this agent to retrieve internal risk scores or to link topics to internal financial models.
instructions: >
  You are a bridge to our internal data systems.
  - When given a company and a risk type, use the 'get_company_risk_profile' tool to fetch the internal score and commentary.
  - When given a topic, use the 'link_to_internal_model_score' tool to associate it with a relevant financial model.
tools:
  - get_company_risk_profile
  - link_to_internal_model_score
```

#### B. Supervisor Agent Definition

This is the most critical component, acting as the "brain" of the operation. Its description tells other agents when to route to it, and its instructions define the multi-step logic for the analysis pipeline.

*File: `agents/FinancialSupervisorAgent.yaml`*
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: FinancialSupervisorAgent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  An expert financial analysis supervisor that orchestrates complex analysis of financial documents like earnings calls and SEC filings. It understands high-level analyst requests and delegates tasks for document ingestion, NLP analysis, and linking data to internal proprietary models. This is the primary agent for all financial analysis tasks.
instructions: >
  You are the master orchestrator for financial analysis requests. Your primary role is to understand the user's analytical goal and execute a precise workflow using your collaborator agents.

  1.  **Deconstruct Request:** First, determine the user's intent. Are they asking to analyze a specific document, or are they asking a general knowledge question?

  2.  **Document Analysis Workflow:** For requests to analyze a specific document (e.g., "analyze the latest earnings call"):
      a.  **Ingestion:** ALWAYS start by using the `DocumentIngestionAgent` to retrieve the document content.
      b.  **NLP Analysis:** Pass the retrieved content to the `NLPAnalysisAgent` to extract topics, risks, and sentiment.
      c.  **Internal Data Linking:** If the analysis from the NLP Agent identifies specific risks or topics, use the `DataLinkerAgent` to connect these entities to our internal company profiles and risk models. For example, if a "SUPPLY_CHAIN" risk is found, query the `DataLinkerAgent` for that risk type.
      d.  **Synthesize & Report:** Combine the findings from all agents into a single, concise, and comprehensive summary for the analyst. Present the information clearly, starting with a high-level summary, followed by detailed findings (e.g., specific risks mentioned, internal risk score).

  3.  **Knowledge Base Workflow:** If the user asks a general knowledge question about an industry, market trends, or common risks (e.g., "what are the risks in the semiconductor industry?"), use the attached `semiconductor_industry_kb` knowledge base to provide a grounded answer. Do NOT use the other collaborator agents for these types of questions.
collaborators:
  - DocumentIngestionAgent
  - NLPAnalysisAgent
  - DataLinkerAgent
knowledge_base:
  - semiconductor_industry_kb
```

### Step 5: Import All Agents

With all configurations defined, run the following commands from your project root to import the agents. The order matters; import collaborators before the supervisor that depends on them.

```bash
# Import collaborator agents
orchestrate agents import -f agents/DocumentIngestionAgent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f agents/NLPAnalysisAgent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f agents/DataLinkerAgent.yaml

# Import the supervisor agent
orchestrate agents import -f agents/FinancialSupervisorAgent.yaml
```

## 4. Verification and Demo Scenarios

Start the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface to test the complete solution.

```bash
orchestrate chat start
```

Once the chat is active, use the `FinancialSupervisorAgent` and run through the following scenarios.

#### Scenario 1: Core Use Case (Multi-Agent Pipeline)

*   **User Prompt:** `"Analyze the latest earnings call from QuantumChip Inc. for mentions of supply chain risk and link it to our internal risk profile."`
*   **Expected Workflow:**
    1.  `FinancialSupervisorAgent` receives the prompt.
    2.  It calls `DocumentIngestionAgent`'s `fetch_sec_filing` tool with `company_ticker="QCI"`.
    3.  The mock transcript is passed to `NLPAnalysisAgent`'s `identify_risk_mentions` tool. The tool identifies the "supply chain disruptions" sentence and returns `{"risk_type": "SUPPLY_CHAIN", ...}`.
    4.  The supervisor sees the `SUPPLY_CHAIN` risk and calls `DataLinkerAgent`'s `get_company_risk_profile` tool with `company_ticker="QCI"` and `risk_type="SUPPLY_CHAIN"`.
    5.  The mock API returns the internal risk score of `7.8` and commentary.
    6.  `FinancialSupervisorAgent` synthesizes all information into a final answer.
*   **Expected Output (similar to):**
    > "I have analyzed the latest earnings call for QuantumChip Inc.
    >
    > **Summary:** The company reported strong demand but is facing significant supply chain challenges that are impacting logistics and putting pressure on gross margins.
    >
    > **Risk Mention:** A specific mention of supply chain risk was found: 'However, we are actively monitoring significant supply chain disruptions in Southeast Asia which are impacting our logistics network.'
    >
    > **Internal Risk Profile:** Our internal model corroborates this concern. The current internal risk score for QuantumChip's supply chain is **7.8**, with the commentary: 'High dependency on single-source suppliers in Southeast Asia.'"

#### Scenario 2: General Knowledge Query (RAG)

*   **User Prompt:** `"What are the most common risks facing the semiconductor industry right now?"`
*   **Expected Workflow:**
    1.  `FinancialSupervisorAgent` receives the prompt.
    2.  Based on its instructions, it identifies this as a general knowledge question.
    3.  It queries the `semiconductor_industry_kb` knowledge base.
    4.  It synthesizes an answer based on the content from the mock PDF reports.
*   **Expected Output (similar to):**
    > "Based on available industry reports, the most common risks facing the semiconductor industry include geopolitical tensions affecting material sourcing, global supply chain resilience, and logistics bottlenecks. Many manufacturers are focusing on diversifying their fabrication locations to mitigate these disruptions."

#### Scenario 3: Comparative Analysis (Advanced Orchestration)

*   **User Prompt:** `"Compare the sentiment regarding R&D spending in the latest filings for QuantumChip Inc. and their main competitor."`
*   **Expected Workflow:**
    1.  The supervisor would need to be enhanced with logic to handle loops or multiple entities. For the demo, it would run the pipeline for "QCI".
    2.  The `NLPAnalysisAgent`'s `analyze_sentiment_by_section` tool would be called.
    3.  The supervisor would report the sentiment for QCI and state that it needs a document for the competitor to complete the comparison.
*   **Expected Output (similar to):**
    > "For QuantumChip Inc., the sentiment regarding R&D spending is noted in the CFO's statement, which is 'Slightly Negative' with a score of -0.3. The summary notes 'increased R&D spending... but expresses concern over margin pressure'. To provide a comparison, please provide the filing for the competitor."

## 5. Troubleshooting

*   **Agent Not Found / Routing Error:** If the supervisor fails to call a collaborator, verify that all agents were imported successfully and that the `collaborators` list in `FinancialSupervisorAgent.yaml` has the exact names of the other agents. Also, ensure the collaborator agent `description` fields are clear and accurate.
*   **Tool Not Found:** Check that all tools were imported without errors using `orchestrate tools import`. Ensure the `tools` list in each agent's YAML file matches the `@tool` name exactly.
*   **Incorrect Tool Usage:** If an agent uses the wrong tool or provides bad inputs, refine the `instructions` in its YAML file. Make the logic more explicit (e.g., "When you see X, ALWAYS use tool Y"). Also, check that the Python tool's docstring is clear and accurately describes its parameters.
*   **Knowledge Base Not Queried:** If the agent doesn't use the KB for general questions, ensure the `knowledge_base` is correctly listed in `FinancialSupervisorAgent.yaml` and that the `instructions` clearly differentiate between the document analysis workflow and the knowledge base workflow.

## 6. Best Practices

*   **Modular Design:** Keep agents and tools specialized. The `DocumentIngestionAgent` only ingests, the `NLPAnalysisAgent` only analyzes. This makes the system easier to maintain and extend.
*   **Descriptive Naming and Descriptions:** The names and descriptions of agents and tools are not just for humans; the LLM uses them for reasoning and routing. Be clear, specific, and descriptive.
*   **Explicit Supervisor Instructions:** The `FinancialSupervisorAgent`'s power comes from its detailed instructions. Clearly define the sequence of operations, conditional logic (if X, then do Y), and how to synthesize results.
*   **Stateless Tools:** Design tools to be stateless. They should take inputs, perform an action, and return an output without relying on previous calls. This makes the system more robust.
*   **Version Control:** Store all your YAML and Python files in a Git repository. This allows you to track changes, collaborate, and roll back to previous versions if needed.
