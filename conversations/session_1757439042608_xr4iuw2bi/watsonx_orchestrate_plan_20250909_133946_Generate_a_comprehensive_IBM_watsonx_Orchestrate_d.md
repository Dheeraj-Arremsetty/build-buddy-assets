# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan for FinCorp Analytics

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building and deploying a sophisticated, multi-agent IBM watsonx Orchestrate solution for a financial services client, "FinCorp Analytics." The primary business challenge is the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of quarterly financial compliance reporting. This solution automates the entire workflow by orchestrating data collection from various sources, performing advanced risk analysis, verifying transactions against regulatory knowledge bases, and generating a final summary report.

The proposed architecture features a supervisor agent, the **Compliance Reporting Supervisor**, which manages and coordinates tasks among three specialized collaborator agents: the **Data Aggregation Agent**, the **Risk Analysis Agent**, and the **Compliance Check Agent**. This modular design ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns, directly addressing FinCorp's need for a robust, auditable, and efficient compliance process. This demo will showcase how watsonx Orchestrate can transform complex enterprise workflows, reduce operational risk, and empower teams to focus on high-value strategic analysis rather than manual data handling.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is set up correctly. This is crucial for the successful creation, import, and execution of the agents and tools outlined in this plan.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK Installed**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is the core command-line tool used for this implementation. Ensure it is installed and configured.
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate"
    ```
2.  **Python Environment**: A working Python environment (version 3.9 or higher) is required to create the custom tools.
3.  **Project Directory Structure**: Create a dedicated directory for the project to keep all artifacts organized.
    ```bash
    mkdir fincorp_orchestrate_demo
    cd fincorp_orchestrate_demo
    mkdir agents tools knowledge_base_docs
    ```
4.  **Environment Initialization**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment initialized. Follow the ADK documentation to log in and set up your environment.
    ```bash
    # Follow prompts to log in and select your environment
    orchestrate login
    orchestrate env init
    ```
5.  **Python Dependencies**: Create a `requirements.txt` file for any third-party libraries used in the custom tools.
    ```bash
    # Create the requirements.txt file
    echo "requests" > requirements.txt

    # Install the dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Step 1: Create the Knowledge Base

The **Compliance Check Agent** will use a knowledge base to verify transactions against a set of financial regulations. This step involves creating a mock regulatory document and a YAML configuration to import it into Orchestrate's built-in vector store.

### 1.1. Create the Regulatory Document

First, create a simple text file containing mock financial regulations. This document will be ingested into the knowledge base.

**Command:** Create the file `knowledge_base_docs/fincorp_regulations.txt`.

```bash
# Create the file and add content
cat <<EOF > knowledge_base_docs/fincorp_regulations.txt
Financial Regulation Mandates for FinCorp Analytics

Document ID: REG-2024-Q3
Version: 1.5

Section 1: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Protocols
1.1: All transactions exceeding $10,000 USD must be flagged for manual review.
1.2: Transactions involving entities on the Sanctioned Parties List (SPL) are strictly prohibited and must be reported immediately.
1.3: A pattern of transactions just below the $10,000 threshold (structuring) must be identified and reported as a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

Section 2: Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Compliance
2.1: All financial reporting data must have a clear and auditable trail from transaction origin to final report.
2.2: Data integrity checks must be performed on all aggregated data sets to ensure no unauthorized modifications have occurred.

Section 3: Know Your Customer (KYC) Guidelines
3.1: All new counterparties must undergo a full KYC verification process before their first transaction.
3.2: Transactions with counterparties with incomplete KYC profiles must be blocked until the profile is complete.
EOF
```

### 1.2. Create the Knowledge Base Configuration File

Next, create the YAML file that defines the knowledge base for Orchestrate. This file points to the document you just created.

**Command:** Create the file `knowledge_base_config.yaml` in the root directory.

```yaml
# knowledge_base_config.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: knowledge_base
name: financial_regulations_kb
description: >
   Contains essential financial regulations and compliance mandates for FinCorp Analytics,
   including Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols.
   Use this to verify if a transaction or activity is compliant.
documents:
   - "knowledge_base_docs/fincorp_regulations.txt"
vector_index:
   embeddings_model_name: ibm/slate-125m-english-rvr-v2
```

### 1.3. Import the Knowledge Base

Use the ADK CLI to import the knowledge base configuration into your Orchestrate environment.

**Command:**

```bash
orchestrate knowledge-bases import -f knowledge_base_config.yaml
```

## Step 2: Create the Custom Tools

This step involves creating the Python-based tools that our agents will use to perform their specialized tasks. Each tool simulates a real-world function, from data aggregation to final report generation, and produces realistic synthetic data.

### 2.1. Tool 1: Data Aggregation (`aggregate_financial_data`)

**Business Value:** This tool simulates the critical first step of any compliance process: gathering raw transaction data from disparate sources like trading platforms, core banking systems, and investment ledgers. By automating this, it eliminates manual data entry errors and dramatically reduces the time required for data collection.

**Technical Implementation:** The tool generates a list of 10 realistic, synthetic financial transactions. Each transaction includes a unique ID, timestamp, amount, currency, status, and counterparty details. This structured JSON output is easily consumable by downstream agents and tools.

**Command:** Create the file `tools/data_aggregation_tool.py`.

```python
# tools/data_aggregation_tool.py
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="aggregate_financial_data", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def aggregate_financial_data(reporting_period: str) -> str:
    """
    Aggregates financial transaction data from various source systems for a specified reporting period.

    This tool simulates fetching data from trading, ledger, and payment systems to create a consolidated
    dataset for compliance analysis.

    Args:
        reporting_period (str): The reporting period to aggregate data for (e.g., "Q3 2024").

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of aggregated financial transactions.
    """
    transactions = []
    base_date = datetime.now()
    counterparties = [
        {"id": "CPTY-001", "name": "Global Trade Inc.", "risk_region": "High"},
        {"id": "CPTY-002", "name": "Innovate Solutions LLC", "risk_region": "Low"},
        {"id": "CPTY-003", "name": "Quantum Holdings", "risk_region": "Medium"},
        {"id": "CPTY-004", "name": "Apex Minerals Corp", "risk_region": "High"},
        {"id": "CPTY-005", "name": "NextGen Pharma", "risk_region": "Low"},
    ]

    for i in range(10):
        transaction_date = base_date - timedelta(days=random.randint(1, 90))
        amount = round(random.uniform(500.0, 25000.0), 2)
        # Ensure at least one transaction is over the $10,000 AML threshold
        if i == 5:
            amount = 15500.75

        transactions.append({
            "transaction_id": f"TRN-{1000 + i}",
            "timestamp": transaction_date.isoformat(),
            "amount": amount,
            "currency": "USD",
            "status": random.choice(["Completed", "Pending"]),
            "source_system": random.choice(["Trading System Alpha", "Core Ledger", "Payments Gateway"]),
            "counterparty": random.choice(counterparties)
        })

    return json.dumps({"transactions": transactions})
```

### 2.2. Tool 2: Risk Analysis (`analyze_transaction_risk`)

**Business Value:** This tool automates the complex task of risk scoring, a cornerstone of modern compliance. It applies predefined business rules to identify high-risk transactions that require
