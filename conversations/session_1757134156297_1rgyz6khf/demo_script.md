- "Meanwhile, the Contract Analyzer Agent extracts key terms, dates, and obligations"
- **Show metric**: "Processing speed: 83 documents per second"

**[10:30 - 12:00] STEP 3: Intelligent Problem Resolution**
```yaml
Action: Trigger a simulated bottleneck
Expected Result: System automatically reallocates resources
```
- "Let me show you something powerful—I'll simulate a processing bottleneck"
- "Watch as the ML Optimization Agent detects the slowdown and automatically spawns additional processor agents"
- "It's also rerouting complex documents to specialized agents while maintaining throughput"
- **Business Impact**: "No human intervention required—the system self-heals"

**[12:00 - 13:30] STEP 4: Quality Assurance & Learning**
```yaml
Action: Show quality metrics dashboard
