# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan

## Overview
This execution plan is designed for a comprehensive demonstration of IBM watsonx Orchestrate, tailored to Xerox's Managed Print Services (MPS). The primary goal is to showcase real-time fleet monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automated supply chain management using synthetic data. This demo aims to highlight the business value of reducing printer downtime by 40%, decreasing emergency service calls by 30%, and saving 25% in supply chain costs, while achieving a 90% customer satisfaction rate.

## Prerequisites
- **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: Ensure the ADK is installed and configured in your development environment.
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for developing custom tools and running scripts.
- **Access to IBM watsonx Platform**: Necessary for deploying agents and accessing LLMs.
- **Knowledge of YAML and Python**: To create configuration files and custom tools.
- **Synthetic Data**: Mock data for IoT sensors, maintenance logs, and supply chain inventory.

## Step 1: Create YAML Configuration

### Fleet Monitoring Agent
**Description**: This agent continuously monitors the printer fleet's health using IoT sensors, providing real-time data analysis. It uses the `watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct` model for effective data interpretation.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: fleet_monitoring_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  An agent that continuously monitors printer fleet health using IoT sensors, providing insights and alerts for real-time data analysis.
instructions: >
  Use tools to gather and analyze sensor data to provide real-time fleet status and alerts.
collaborators:
  - predictive_maintenance_agent
tools:
  - fleet_health_checker
  - sensor_data_collector
```

### Predictive Maintenance Agent
**Description**: This agent analyzes data patterns to forecast maintenance needs, leveraging AI-driven insights to optimize maintenance schedules.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: predictive_maintenance_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: planner
description: >
  An agent that uses data patterns to predict maintenance needs, optimizing schedules and reducing downtime.
instructions: >
  Analyze historical maintenance data to forecast future needs and schedule maintenance proactively.
collaborators:
  - fleet_monitoring_agent
tools:
  - maintenance_predictor
  - anomaly_detector
```

### Supply Chain Automation Agent
**Description**: This agent automates the supply order and service scheduling process, ensuring seamless operations and cost efficiency.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: supply_chain_automation_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: react
description: >
  An agent that automates supply chain processes, triggering orders and scheduling services to enhance operational efficiency.
instructions: >
  Use tools to automate supply orders and schedule services based on fleet monitoring insights.
collaborators:
  - predictive_maintenance_agent
tools:
  - order_trigger
  - service_scheduler
```

## Step 2: Create Tools

### Fleet Health Checker
**Purpose**: Collects and analyzes sensor data to assess the health of the printer fleet.

```python
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission
import random
import json

@tool(name="fleet_health_checker", description="Checks health of printer fleet using sensor data", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fleet_health_checker() -> dict:
    """Collects sensor data to assess the health of the printer fleet."""
    data = {
        "fleet_status": "healthy" if random.random() > 0.2 else "issue_detected",
        "timestamp": "2023-10-15T10:00:00Z",
        "details": "All systems operational" if random.random() > 0.2 else "Paper jam detected in Printer 5"
    }
    return data
```

### Maintenance Predictor
**Purpose**: Analyzes past maintenance records to predict future maintenance needs.

```python
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission
import random

@tool(name="maintenance_predictor", description="Predicts maintenance needs based on historical data", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def maintenance_predictor() -> dict:
    """Forecasts maintenance needs to prevent unplanned downtime."""
    prediction = {
        "next_maintenance": "2023-11-01",
        "expected_issues": "High toner consumption",
        "confidence_score": random.uniform(0.7, 0.95)
    }
    return prediction
```

### Order Trigger
**Purpose**: Automates supply orders based on current inventory levels and predicted needs.

```python
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="order_trigger", description="Triggers supply orders based on inventory levels", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def order_trigger() -> dict:
    """Automates supply ordering to maintain optimal inventory levels."""
    order_details = {
        "order_id": "ORD123456",
        "items": ["Toner", "Paper"],
        "order_date": "2023-10-15",
        "estimated_delivery": "2023-10-20"
    }
    return order_details
```

## Step 3: Import Tools and Agents

### Import Tools
Execute the following CLI commands to import the tools into the watsonx Orchestrate platform:

```bash
orchestrate tools import -k python -f fleet_health_checker.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f maintenance_predictor.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f order_trigger.py
```

### Import Agents
Execute the following CLI commands to import the agents:

```bash
orchestrate agents import -f fleet_monitoring_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f predictive_maintenance_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f supply_chain_automation_agent.yaml
```

## Verification
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify each agent's functionality by simulating real-time data inputs and ensuring correct responses.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between agents and tools to ensure seamless operation across the system.
3. **Performance Testing**: Assess the system's ability to handle large volumes of synthetic data without degradation in performance.

## Troubleshooting
- **Agent Import Errors**: Ensure YAML files are correctly formatted and paths are accurate.
- **Tool Execution Failures**: Verify Python scripts are free from syntax errors and required libraries are installed.
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Validate synthetic data generation logic and ensure timestamps and IDs are correctly formatted.

## Best Practices
- **Data Validation**: Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected data inputs.
- **Scalability**: Design agents and tools with scalability in mind to accommodate potential expansion in data volume.
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure all data handling and storage practices comply with relevant data protection regulations.

By following this comprehensive execution plan, Xerox will be able to effectively demonstrate the capabilities of IBM watsonx Orchestrate in optimizing their Managed Print Services, showcasing significant improvements in efficiency and cost savings.
