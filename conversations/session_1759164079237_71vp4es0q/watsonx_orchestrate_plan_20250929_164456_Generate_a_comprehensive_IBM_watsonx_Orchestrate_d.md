# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Empower Agent for Employee Success

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building and deploying a sophisticated, multi-agent solution within IBM watsonx Orchestrate for your client. The goal is to create the **"Empower" agent**, a digital assistant designed to streamline employee support by acting as a central point of contact for HR, benefits, and IT service management. The Empower agent leverages a modular architecture, collaborating with specialized agents for **Customer Care** (handling benefits and claims) and **ServiceNow** (managing IT incidents). This approach demonstrates the power of watsonx Orchestrate to automate complex, cross-functional workflows, reduce manual effort for the support team, and provide employees with immediate, accurate, and contextual assistance.

The demo will showcase how a supervisor agent can intelligently delegate tasks to collaborator agents, how agents can use custom Python tools to interact with enterprise systems (simulated via synthetic data), and how a knowledge base can provide answers to common policy questions. This plan is tailored to the client's specific "Empower" concept, providing all necessary code, configuration files, and commands to build a fully functional and impressive proof of concept.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is set up with the following components. This foundation is essential for using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) to build, import, and test the solution.

1.  **Python 3.10 or higher**: The watsonx Orchestrate ADK is a Python library. Ensure a compatible version of Python is installed and accessible from your command line.
2.  **pip (Python Package Installer)**: This is required to install the ADK and other Python dependencies. It is typically included with modern Python installations.
3.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The core toolkit for building and managing agents and tools. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
4.  **watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: You must have access to an IBM watsonx Orchestrate instance (SaaS or Developer Edition) and have configured your local ADK to connect to it. Follow the official documentation for `orchestrate login`.
5.  **Text Editor or IDE**: A code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for creating and editing Python and YAML files.

## Step 1: Project Setup

A well-organized project structure is crucial for managing the different components of your solution. Create the following directory structure in your chosen workspace. This separation of agents, tools, and knowledge base documents simplifies development and deployment.

```text
empower-demo/
├── agents/
│   ├── customer_care_agent.yaml
│   ├── service_now_agent.yaml
│   └── empower_agent.yaml
├── tools/
│   ├── customer_care/
│   │   ├── get_healthcare_benefits.py
│   │   ├── get_my_claims.py

├── knowledge_base/
│   ├── docs/
│   │   └── company_faq.txt
│   └── employee_faq_kb.yaml
└── requirements.txt
```

**Action**: Create these folders and empty files manually before proceeding to the next steps.

## Step 2: Create the Tools

Tools are the functional building blocks of your agents, enabling them to perform specific actions. We will create six Python-based tools, divided into two categories: Customer Care and ServiceNow. Each tool will generate realistic synthetic data to simulate interactions with backend enterprise systems.

### Customer Care Tools

These tools simulate interactions with a healthcare or benefits management system.

#### 1. `get_healthcare_benefits.py`

**Business Value**: This tool empowers employees to self-serve information about their healthcare plans. It provides immediate access to complex benefits data, such as deductibles and co-pays, reducing the need to contact HR for routine questions and allowing employees to make informed decisions about their healthcare.

**Technical Implementation**: The tool uses an Enum for plan types and makes a (mocked) API call to fetch benefits data. It can filter by plan and network status, returning a structured list of benefits. The Pydantic models ensure data validation and clear type hinting.

*   Create the file `empower-demo/tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py` and add the following code:

```python
# empower-demo/tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py
from enum import Enum
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

class Plan(str, Enum):
    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'
    PPO = 'PPO'

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_healthcare_benefits(plan: Plan, in_network: bool = None):
    """Retrieves a comprehensive list of health benefits data, organized by coverage type and plan variant.

    This data includes details such as annual deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and various co-pays or
    percentages for medical services under different network plans (HDHP, HDHP Plus, and PPO).

    Args:
        plan (Plan): The plan the user is currently on. Can be one of "HDHP", "HDHP Plus", or "PPO".
        in_network (bool, optional): Whether the user wants coverage for in-network or out-of-network.
            If not provided, both will be returned.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains details on coverage.
    """
    # In a real scenario, this would make an API call. Here, we generate synthetic data.
    all_benefits = [
        {'Coverage': 'Annual Deductible', 'HDHP (In-Network)': '$3,000', 'HDHP (Out-of-Network)': '$6,000', 'PPO (In-Network)': '$1,000'},
        {'Coverage': 'Out-of-Pocket Max', 'HDHP (In-Network)': '$7,000', 'HDHP (Out-of-Network)': '$14,000', 'PPO (In-Network)': '$5,000'},
        {'Coverage': 'Primary Care Visit', 'HDHP (In-Network)': '100% after deductible', 'HDHP (Out-of-Network)': '80% after deductible', 'PPO (In-Network)': '$30 co-pay'},
        {'Coverage': 'Specialist Visit', 'HDHP (In-Network)': '100% after deductible', 'HDHP (Out-of-Network)': '80% after deductible', 'PPO (In-Network)': '$50 co-pay'},
        {'Coverage': 'Emergency Room', 'HDHP (In-Network)': '$500 co-pay then 100%', 'HDHP (Out-of-Network)': '$500 co-pay then 80%', 'PPO (In-Network)': '$250 co-pay'}
    ]
    
    # Simple filtering logic based on input
    if plan == Plan.HDHP:
        return [b for b in all_benefits if 'HDHP' in ' '.join(b.keys())]
    elif plan == Plan.PPO:
        return [b for b in all_benefits if 'PPO' in ' '.join(b.keys())]
    else:
        return all_benefits
```

#### 2. `get_my_claims.py`

**Business Value**: This tool provides employees with on-demand access to the status of their medical claims. It eliminates the uncertainty and follow-up calls typically associated with claim processing, improving employee satisfaction and transparency.

**Technical Implementation**: The function returns a hardcoded list of dictionaries, each representing a claim with varying statuses ('Processed', 'Pending', 'Rejected'). This demonstrates how the agent can handle and present structured data with different states.

*   Create the file `empower-demo/tools/customer_care/get_my_claims.py` and add the following code:

```python
# empower-demo/tools/customer_care/get_my_claims.py
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(
