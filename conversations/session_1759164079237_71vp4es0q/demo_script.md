### **Section 1: Opening & The Modern Employee's Challenge (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

*   **(Slide 1: Title Slide - "Empowering Employee Success with IBM watsonx Orchestrate")**
*   "Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I'm excited to show you how IBM is revolutionizing the employee experience."
*   "In today's hybrid work environment, our employees interact with the company through a dozen different digital doors. There’s the HR portal for benefits, the IT service desk for tech issues, SharePoint for documents, and many more."
*   "This creates what we call 'digital friction.' Employees spend valuable time figuring out *where* to go and *who* to ask, instead of focusing on their actual jobs. This leads to frustration, lost productivity, and a heavy burden on your internal support teams."

*   **(Slide 2: The Problem - "The Swivel Chair Dilemma")**
    *   **Image:** A diagram showing an employee in the middle, surrounded by logos for ServiceNow, a generic HR system, a benefits portal, etc., with confusing arrows between them.
*   "This is the 'swivel chair' dilemma. An employee trying to solve a simple problem, like getting a document for a healthcare claim, might have to:
    1.  Log into the IT portal because they can't access the benefits site.
    2.  Wait for the IT ticket to be resolved.
    3.  Log into the benefits portal.
    4.  Struggle to find the right information.
    5.  Finally, call the HR support line."
*   "This isn't just an inconvenience; it's a direct hit to your bottom line. It increases operational costs, lowers employee satisfaction, and slows down the entire business."
*   "What if you could provide a single, intelligent, and conversational front door for all these requests? A digital assistant that doesn't just answer questions, but takes action across your enterprise systems. That's what we've built with the 'Empower' agent, powered by IBM watsonx Orchestrate."

### **Section 2: The Solution - A Team of Digital Specialists (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

*   **(Slide 3: The Solution - "The Empower Agent: Your AI Concierge")**
    *   **Image:** A clear architectural diagram. A central "Empower Agent (Supervisor)" icon connects to a "Customer Care Agent" icon and a "ServiceNow Agent" icon. Each of those collaborator agents points to its respective tools (e.g., `get_my_claims`, `create_incident`).
*   "The Empower agent is not another monolithic chatbot. It’s a **supervisor agent**—an AI team lead that manages a team of specialized digital workers."
*   "In our demo today, Empower manages two specialists:
    *   The **Customer Care Agent:** An expert on all things benefits, claims, and healthcare providers.
    *   The **ServiceNow Agent:** The go-to specialist for creating and managing IT support incidents."
*   "When an employee makes a request, the Empower agent's job is to understand the intent and **intelligently delegate the task** to the right specialist. This composable, multi-agent approach is what makes watsonx Orchestrate so powerful. It mirrors how your human teams work—you go to the expert for the best results."
*   "This architecture is flexible, scalable, and allows you to add new skills and connect to new systems without rebuilding the entire solution from scratch. Let's see it in action."

### **Section 3: Live Demo - The Empower Agent at Work (8 minutes)**

**(Presenter switches to the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface)**

**Presenter:** "Alright, I'm now in the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface, playing the role of an employee. Let's walk through a few common scenarios."

#### **Scenario 1: Simple Benefits Inquiry (Self-Service & Immediacy)**

*   **Presenter:** "Let's start with a straightforward benefits question. I'm considering my options for next year's open enrollment."
*   **Action:** Type the following prompt into the chat:
    > **"What are the key differences between the PPO and HDHP plans?"**
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The chat will show that the `Empower` agent received the request.
    *   It will then show that it delegated the task to the `customer_care_agent`.
    *   The `customer_care_agent` will invoke the `get_healthcare_benefits` tool.
    *   A clean, formatted markdown table will appear in the chat, comparing the PPO and HDHP plans side-by-side with details on deductibles, co-pays, and out-of-pocket maximums.
*   **Key Message:** "Look at that. In seconds, I have a clear, easy-to-read comparison. No searching through confusing PDF documents or waiting on hold. This is immediate, on-demand self-service that empowers employees and deflects calls from your HR team."

#### **Scenario 2: Creating an IT Incident (Streamlining Support)**

*   **Presenter:** "Now, let's say I'm having a technical issue. I'm trying to add my newborn to my health plan, but I can't generate the required documents from the portal."
*   **Action:** Type the following prompt into the chat:
    > **"I'm having trouble generating the benefits verification letter to add my daughter to my plan. The portal is giving me an error. Can you help?"**
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The `Empower` agent understands the user is facing difficulty and that it's a technical issue.
    *   It delegates the task to the `service_now_agent`.
    *   The `service_now_agent` invokes the `create_service_now_incident` tool with a well-formed description like "User unable to generate benefits verification letter due to portal error."
    *   The agent responds conversationally: "I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble. I've created an IT incident for you to resolve this. The ticket number is **INC0010042**. A support agent will reach out to you shortly."
*   **Key Message:** "This is seamless. The employee didn't need to know what a 'ServiceNow ticket' is or navigate to a separate helpdesk site. They stated their problem in natural language, and the agent took the correct action, turning a frustrating experience into a streamlined support interaction. This reduces the mean time to resolution and improves the employee experience."

#### **Scenario 3: Complex, Multi-Step Request (Intelligent Task Decomposition)**

*   **Presenter:** "This is where the magic of the supervisor agent really shines. Let's give it a more complex, two-part question that would typically require visiting two different systems."
*   **Action:** Type the following prompt into the chat:
    > **"First, can you check the status of my recent medical claim? And also, I need to find a network-approved cardiologist in Austin, TX."**
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The `Empower` agent will recognize there are two distinct tasks in this request.
    *   **Task 1 (Claim Status):** It will first delegate to the `customer_care_agent`, which will use the `get_my_claims` tool. The agent will respond with a formatted table showing the user's claims, including `CLM1234567` with a status of 'Processed'.
    *   **Task 2 (Provider Search):** Immediately after, it will again delegate to the `customer_care_agent` for the second part of the request. The agent will use the `search_healthcare_providers` tool with the parameters `specialty='Cardiology'` and `location='Austin, TX'`. It will return the contact information for the provider found by the tool.
*   **Key Message:** "This is the highlight. The Empower agent didn't get confused. It broke down a complex request, identified the two separate tasks, and delegated them to the correct specialist in sequence. This demonstrates true AI-powered orchestration, not just simple Q&A. This is how you automate entire workflows, not just single tasks."

### **Section 4: How It's Built & Business Value (4 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

*   **(Slide 4: How It's Built - "Simple Building Blocks, Powerful Results")**
    *   **Content:** Show snippets of the `empower_agent.yaml` (highlighting the `collaborators` section) and the Python code for the `create_service_now_incident.py` tool (highlighting the `@tool` decorator and the docstring).
*   **Technical Highlights:**
    *   "What you just saw was built rapidly using the **watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK)**."
    *   "We define our business logic—the connections to your real systems—using standard **Python**. The `@tool` decorator and a clear docstring are all it takes to make a function available to an agent."
    *   "The agents themselves are defined in simple **YAML files**. This is where we give the agent its instructions, its persona, and most importantly, its team of collaborators. This low-code approach makes it incredibly fast to build, test, and extend."
    *   "This isn't a black box. It's an open, developer-friendly framework that leverages the skills your teams already have."

*   **(Slide 5: Business Value & ROI - "From Friction to Flow")**
    *   **Content:** A summary slide with three columns: Employee Experience, Operational Efficiency, and Business Agility.
*   **Business Value Proposition:**
    *   "So, what does this mean for your business?
    *   **For Your Employees:** You provide a single, intuitive front door to the enterprise. This reduces frustration, boosts satisfaction, and lets them focus on high-value work. **(Improved EX & Productivity)**"
    *   **For Your Operations:** You automate high-volume, repetitive tasks, deflecting up to 40-50% of common HR and IT support tickets. This frees up your support staff to handle more complex, strategic issues. **(Reduced Operational Costs)**"
    *   **For Your Business:** The composable architecture means you can add new skills and connect to new systems in days, not months. As your business evolves, your digital workforce evolves with it. **(Increased Agility & Scalability)**"

### **Section 5: Q&A and Next Steps (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

*   **(Slide 6: Q&A)**
*   "With that, I'd like to open it up for any questions you may have."

**Prepared Q&A Scenarios:**

1.  **Q: The demo used fake data. How does this connect to our *real* enterprise systems?**
    *   **A:** Great question. The Python tools we showed are the integration points. Instead of returning hardcoded data, they would make secure API calls to your actual ServiceNow instance, your Workday HRIS, or any other system with an API. watsonx Orchestrate has robust connection and credential management to handle this securely.

2.  **Q: How does the supervisor agent know which collaborator to send the task to?**
    *   **A:** It's based on the descriptions you provide for each collaborator agent in their YAML files. The supervisor's underlying Large Language Model reads the user's request and compares it to the descriptions of its available specialists to find the best match. This is why well-written descriptions are key.

3.  **Q: How long would it take to build a solution like this for our company?**
    *   **A:** The beauty of the ADK is speed. A proof-of-concept like the one you saw today can be built in a matter of days. A production-ready solution depends on the complexity and number of systems you want to integrate, but you're looking at a timeline of weeks, not months or years.

4.  **Q: What about security and permissions? We don't want every employee to be able to do everything.**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. Access to tools and agents is governed by the user's permissions within watsonx Orchestrate. You can define roles and ensure that an employee can only execute actions they are authorized to perform, maintaining your existing security and governance policies.

*   **(Slide 7: Next Steps)**
*   "Thank you again for your time. The 'Empower' agent is a perfect example of how you can build a truly intelligent and responsive digital workforce."
*   **Call to Action:** "Our next step would be to schedule a discovery workshop with your team. We can identify the top 2-3 high-impact use cases at your organization and map out a plan to build a proof-of-concept that delivers immediate value."
*   "We'll be following up to schedule that session. Have a great rest of your day."
