## Step 2: Create Python Tools for Actionable Tasks

While knowledge bases provide answers from documents, tools allow agents to perform actions or retrieve dynamic, structured data. We will create a set of Python-based tools for each specialized domain. These tools will generate realistic synthetic data, simulating interactions with live business systems like a POS or HR information system.

In the `tools/` directory, create the following Python files:

**2.1. Operations Tools (`operations_tools.py`)**

This toolset provides access to structured operational data and procedures. It helps managers execute daily tasks correctly, ensuring compliance and reducing errors, which directly contributes to the goal of "Operational Excellence".
