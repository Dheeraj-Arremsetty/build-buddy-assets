### **Demo Presentation Script: IBM watsonx Orchestrate**

**Title:** Supercharging Xerox Agent Builder: From Specialized Agents to a Coordinated Digital Workforce

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Demo Specialist Name]

**Audience:** Xerox Stakeholders (AI Strategy, Product Management for Agent Builder, Business Process Automation Leaders)

**Total Time:** 20 Minutes

**Objective:** To demonstrate how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can act as a master orchestration layer for agents built with Xerox® Agent Builder, transforming a collection of specialized bots into a cohesive, intelligent system that automates complex, end-to-end business processes and multiplies the ROI of Xerox's AI strategy.

### **Section 1: Opening & Contextual Alignment (2 Minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **(Acknowledge and Validate):** "Good morning, thank you for your time. We've been following Xerox's journey closely, particularly the 'Reinvention' plan and the strategic pivot towards Intelligent Workplace Services. It's clear you're building the future of the digital workplace, moving beyond the document to manage the entire flow of information."
*   **(Praise the Foundation):** "The Xerox® Agent Builder is a fantastic initiative. You're successfully democratizing AI, empowering business users to create agents that solve specific, tangible problems. You're building an army of digital specialists."
*   **(Introduce the Core Idea - The "Supervisor"):** "Our conversation today is about taking that powerful foundation to the next level. What happens when you have dozens, or even hundreds, of these specialist agents? How do you coordinate them to tackle complex, multi-step processes? We're here to show you how watsonx Orchestrate can act as the **'supervisor'** for your agent ecosystem—the digital foreman that directs your skilled digital workforce."

**(Key Message)**
This isn't about replacing Agent Builder; it's about **supercharging** it. We want to create a "better together" story that enhances your platform and accelerates your transition to a services-led model.

### **Section 2: The Business Challenge: The Orchestration Gap (2 Minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **(The Problem of Silos):** "As your Agent Builder ecosystem grows, you'll inevitably face an 'orchestration gap.' You have a document generation agent, a compliance agent, an approval agent—but they operate in silos. The human employee is still the connective tissue, manually triggering each agent in sequence."
*   **(Illustrate the Pain Points):**
    *   **Manual Handoffs:** A user has to take the output from Agent A and feed it as the input to Agent B. This is slow and prone to error.
    *   **Lack of End-to-End Visibility:** It's difficult to track a process like 'new vendor onboarding' from start to finish when it involves multiple, disconnected agents.
    *   **Complex User Experience:** Instead of making one simple request in natural language, the user has to remember the names and functions of multiple agents and the correct order to use them.
*   **(Frame the Opportunity):** "The true value isn't just automating the individual tasks, but in automating the **entire business process**. The goal is to allow an employee to make one high-level request and have a system intelligently deconstruct it, delegate the work, handle exceptions, and report back upon completion."

**(Key Message)**
Specialized agents are powerful, but without a supervisor, you have a collection of skilled workers with no foreman. watsonx Orchestrate is that foreman.

### **Section 3: The Solution: watsonx Orchestrate as the Supervisor (2 Minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **(Introduce watsonx Orchestrate):** "watsonx Orchestrate is an AI-powered automation platform that uses a large language model to understand a user's intent and then selects, sequences, and combines the right skills—or in this case, the right Xerox agents—to get the job done."
*   **(Explain the Architecture):** "Imagine a 'Supervisor Agent' built in Orchestrate. Its collaborators aren't just tools; they are the specialist agents you've already built with Agent Builder.
    *   The user talks to **one** Supervisor Agent.
    *   The Supervisor understands the end-goal (e.g., "Onboard a new vendor").
    *   It then delegates the sub-tasks in the correct order:
        1.  "Hey, `Document_Generation_Agent`, create the MSA."
        2.  "Hey, `Compliance_Check_Agent`, review this draft."
        3.  "Hey, `Approval_Routing_Agent`, submit this compliant draft."
*   **(Highlight the Simplicity):** "This entire workflow is defined with simple instructions in plain English. You don't need complex BPMN diagrams or brittle code. You're essentially teaching the supervisor how to manage its team."

**(Value Proposition)**
One prompt, one end-to-end process, zero manual intervention. We turn fragmented tasks into a seamless, automated workflow.

### **Section 4: Live Demo: The Contract Lifecycle, Orchestrated (7 Minutes)**

"Let's make this real. I'm going to play the role of a contract manager at Xerox. My goal is to generate a new Master Service Agreement for a vendor, ensure it's compliant, and submit it for approval. I'll be interacting with a single Supervisor Agent we've built in watsonx Orchestrate."

**Demo Flow:**

**(Scenario 1: The End-to-End Happy Path - 3 mins)**

*   **Action:** Open the watsonx Orchestrate chat and select the `Xerox_Workflow_Supervisor` agent.
*   **Presenter:** "I'll start with a high-level, compound request that involves multiple steps."
*   **User Prompt:** `Generate a new Master Service Agreement for 'Innovate Inc.' and get it ready for approval.`
*   **Presenter Narration (as Orchestrate works):**
    *   "Right now, the Supervisor is breaking down my request. It sees the keyword 'Generate' and knows it needs to delegate to the `Document_Generation_Agent` first."
    *   "That agent is now running its Python tool, pulling data from our vendor CSV, merging it with the MSA template, and saving the draft. It just confirmed the draft is created at `drafts/Innovate_Inc_MSA.txt`."
    *   "Now, the Supervisor's instructions tell it the next step is *always* compliance. It's passing that document path to the `Compliance_Check_Agent`."
    *   "This agent is using its built-in knowledge base—our corporate policy PDFs—to perform a RAG-based check. It's confirming the 'Net 30' payment term is compliant."
    *   "Because the compliance check passed, the Supervisor proceeds to the final step: delegating to the `Approval_Routing_Agent`, which is now calling a mock API to push this into an external system."
*   **Expected Outcome (Show on screen):** The Supervisor agent responds: `The contract for Innovate Inc. has been drafted, verified for compliance, and submitted for approval. The tracking ID is [mock_tracking_id].`
*   **Presenter:** "And there you have it. One request, three different specialist agents, three different tools, all coordinated seamlessly in seconds."

**(Scenario 2: Intelligent Exception Handling - 2 mins)**

*   **Presenter:** "But what happens when things aren't perfect? A key role of a supervisor is to catch problems. Let's imagine a contract was drafted with non-standard 'Net 90' payment terms."
*   **User Prompt:** `Draft a contract for 'Global Tech' and submit it.` (A version with Net 90 terms has been pre-configured).
*   **Presenter Narration:**
    *   "The first step is the same—the `Document_Generation_Agent` creates the draft."
    *   "But now, when the `Compliance_Check_Agent` reviews the document, its knowledge base will flag that 'Net 90' violates the standard policy."
    *   "Crucially, the Supervisor's instructions tell it: **if compliance fails, stop.** Do not proceed to the approval step."
*   **Expected Outcome (Show on screen):** The Supervisor responds: `I have drafted the contract for Global Tech, but the 90-day payment terms violate our standard Net 30 policy. Please advise if I should proceed with an exception or revise the terms.`
*   **Presenter:** "This is incredibly powerful. It's not just automation; it's intelligent, risk-aware automation. We've just prevented a non-compliant document from entering the official workflow, saving time and mitigating risk."

**(Scenario 3: Direct Specialist Query - 2 mins)**

*   **Presenter:** "Finally, what if I don't need a full workflow? What if I just have a quick question? The Supervisor is smart enough to route simple queries directly to the right specialist."
*   **User Prompt:** `Is a clause requiring 'Net 60' payment terms compliant with our policies?`
*   **Presenter Narration:** "The Supervisor recognizes this is a direct question for the `Compliance_Check_Agent`. It bypasses the other agents and sends the query straight to the expert."
*   **Expected Outcome (Show on screen):** The `Compliance_Check_Agent` responds directly: `No, a 'Net 60' payment term is not compliant. The standard corporate policy requires 'Net 30' payment terms unless an exception is approved by the VP of Finance.`
*   **Presenter:** "This shows the flexibility of the model. The Supervisor acts as a single, intelligent front door to all of your digital capabilities."

### **Section 5: Technical Highlights & How It Works (2 Minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **(Keep it high-level and connect to the demo):** "What you just saw is enabled by a few simple but powerful concepts in our Agent Development Kit, or ADK."
*   **Supervisor Agent (`native agent`):** "The Supervisor is a 'native agent' in Orchestrate. Its logic is defined by its `instructions`—the step-by-step English-language guide we give it on how to manage the workflow and handle exceptions."
*   **Collaborator Agents (`collaborators`):** "The Xerox-built agents are listed as `collaborators`. The Supervisor knows which one to use based on their `description`. A well-written description like 'specializes in document compliance checks' is all the LLM needs to route tasks correctly."
*   **Tools (`python`, `openapi`):** "The actions are performed by `tools`. We showed a Python-based tool for document generation and an OpenAPI-based tool for the approval API. This means you can connect your agents to virtually any script, application, or system."
*   **Knowledge Base (`knowledge_base`):** "The compliance check was powered by a `knowledge_base`. We simply pointed Orchestrate at your PDF policy documents, and it automatically vectorized them for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). There's no need to manually train a model on your internal data."

**(Key Message)**
This is a low-code, highly extensible framework. You define the logic in natural language and connect to your existing tools and agents, whether they are Python scripts, enterprise APIs, or agents from the Xerox Agent Builder.

### **Section 6: Q&A Preparation (Anticipated Questions - 3 Minutes)**

**Q1: How would this actually integrate with our Xerox Agent Builder?**
> **A:** It's a very flexible integration. The Orchestrate Supervisor can call your Xerox-built agents in a few ways. If your agents expose an API endpoint, we can call them via an OpenAPI tool. If they can be packaged as a Python function, we can import them directly. The key is that Orchestrate acts as the "caller" or "client" to the services your agents provide.

**Q2: What about security and governance? Our documents are sensitive.**
> **A:** Security is paramount. watsonx Orchestrate runs within the secure watsonx platform. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. For tools, you control the connections and credentials. The Python tool we showed runs in your local environment, so the documents never have to leave your control. For knowledge bases, you can connect to your own secure vector databases like Milvus or Elasticsearch.

**Q3: What skills do we need to build a Supervisor Agent?**
> **A:** The primary skill is understanding the business process. As you saw, the agent's instructions are written in natural language. The technical part involves defining the tools, which is straightforward for anyone familiar with Python or OpenAPI specifications. It's a task for a business analyst and a developer working together, which is much faster than traditional integration projects.

**Q4: How is this different from traditional RPA or workflow tools?**
> **A:** Three key ways:
> 1.  **Language-based:** It's driven by a large language model, allowing for flexible, natural language interaction and dynamic workflow creation, unlike brittle, screen-scraping RPA bots.
> 2.  **AI-Powered Delegation:** The Supervisor dynamically chooses the right agent based on its understanding of the request and the agents' descriptions. It's not a rigid, pre-defined flowchart.
> 3.  **Extensibility:** It's built to connect AI agents, not just automate UI clicks. It's designed for the modern, AI-driven enterprise.
