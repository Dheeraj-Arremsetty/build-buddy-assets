  - For any questions about stock, inventory, or product levels, use the Inventory_Manager_Agent.
  - For questions about 'how to' do something, procedures, policies, or recipes, use the Operations_Knowledge_Agent.
  - If the user wants to report a broken, faulty, or malfunctioning piece of equipment, use the Maintenance_Reporter_Agent.
