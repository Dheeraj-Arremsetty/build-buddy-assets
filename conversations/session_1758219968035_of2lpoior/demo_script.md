---

### **Section 1: Opening & Business Context (2 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Acknowledge and Validate:** Start by showing you've done your research and understand their business. This builds immediate credibility.
*   **Align with Their Current Strategy:** Recognize their existing work with AI. Position Orchestrate as the logical next step, not a replacement.
*   **Set the Agenda:** Clearly state the purpose of the presentation.

**(Script)**

"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. We at IBM have been following Core Power Yoga's journey for some time, and it's clear you've masterfully built more than just a collection of studios—you've created a powerful lifestyle brand and a community.

Our research highlights your position as the largest yoga studio operator in the U.S. and, importantly, your forward-thinking approach to technology. We know you're already leveraging AI with Google's Agent Builder to create internal and external knowledge agents like 'CPY Genius.' That's a fantastic foundation, proving you understand the power of AI in streamlining information access.

Today, we're here to show you the next evolution of that strategy. We're going to explore how we can move from an AI that *answers* questions to a digital teammate that *takes action* and resolves member needs end-to-end. We'll demonstrate how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can help you build a **Studio Concierge AI** to automate member services, free up your incredible studio staff, and deliver the seamless digital experience your members have come to expect."

### **Section 2: The Evolving Member Expectation & The Business Challenge (3 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Frame the Problem:** Define the gap between member expectations and current capabilities.
*   **Highlight the "Handoff Problem":** An informational AI is helpful, but it often creates a new task for the user or an employee.
*   **Introduce the Opportunity Cost:** What is the cost of staff spending time on repetitive administrative tasks instead of high-value, community-building interactions?

**(Script)**

"Your competitors, like Peloton and Equinox, are leveraging AI for hyper-personalization. The modern fitness consumer now expects instant, 24/7, self-service capabilities. They want to manage their memberships as easily as they manage their Netflix account.

Your current AI agents are excellent at providing information. A member can ask, 'What is your membership cancellation policy?' and get an instant, accurate answer. But what happens next? The member then has to find the right email address, compose a message, and wait for a human to process it. This is the **'handoff problem.'** The AI provides the 'what,' but the member or your staff still has to do the 'how.'

This creates two challenges:
1.  **Member Friction:** It's an extra step in their journey, a small roadblock that can impact their overall experience.
2.  **Operational Inefficiency:** Your highly-trained studio managers and front-desk staff, who are masters at building community and driving sales, are spending valuable time on repetitive administrative tasks—processing holds, answering the same questions, and managing bookings.

The key question is: How can we close this gap and empower a single AI interaction to resolve a member's need completely, from question to confirmation?"

### **Section 3: Solution Overview - The Studio Concierge AI with watsonx Orchestrate (2 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Introduce Orchestrate:** Position it as the "how" – the platform that connects conversational AI to your business processes.
*   **Explain the Architecture Simply:** Use an analogy like a "manager" and "specialists" to describe the supervisor-collaborator model.
*   **State the Value Proposition:** This isn't just a chatbot; it's a digital workforce multiplier.

**(Script)**

"This is precisely where IBM watsonx Orchestrate comes in. Orchestrate is a platform for building AI agents that don't just chat—they *do*. It allows you to create digital teammates that can reason, delegate, and use tools to execute complex tasks.

For Core Power Yoga, we propose building the **Studio Concierge AI**. Think of it as a highly efficient assistant manager. This AI is built using a powerful supervisor-collaborator architecture:

*   **The Supervisor (`StudioConciergeAgent`):** This is the 'manager.' It understands the member's overall goal and intelligently routes tasks to the right specialist.
*   **The Information Specialist (`PolicyAndScheduleAgent`):** This agent is like your 'CPY Genius.' It’s connected to a **Knowledge Base** of your official documents—policies, schedules, FAQs—to provide accurate, grounded answers.
*   **The Action Specialist (`MemberServicesAgent`):** This is the game-changer. This agent has a set of **Tools** that allow it to securely connect to your backend systems to perform actions like booking a class, updating a profile, or, as we'll see, placing a membership on hold.

With this model, you get an AI that can handle multi-step, complex requests in a single, seamless conversation."

### **Section 4: Live Demo - A Day in the Life of a CPY Member (5 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Set the Scene:** Introduce the persona and the interface.
*   **Start Simple:** Begin with an informational query to show parity with their existing system.
*   **Escalate Complexity:** Move to a multi-turn conversation that requires both information and action.
*   **The "Wow" Moment:** Show the AI successfully understanding and executing the transactional request.

**(Script)**

"Alright, let's see the Studio Concierge AI in action. I'm going to play the role of Alex, a Core Power Yoga All Access member. I'm interacting with the AI through a simple chat window that could be embedded in your website or mobile app.

**(Step 1: Simple Informational Query)**

*   **Alex (User) Types:** `I want to bring a friend to class on Saturday. What's the guest policy?`

*   **Presenter:** "First, a straightforward question. The Supervisor agent recognizes this is an informational request and passes it to our Information Specialist."

*   **Expected Outcome (AI Response):** `Members can bring a guest for a drop-in fee of $25 per class. The same guest is limited to 2 visits per month. All guests must sign a liability waiver upon arrival. (Source: studio_policies.txt)`

*   **Presenter:** "Notice the AI gives a direct, accurate answer and even cites the source document. This builds trust and transparency."

**(Step 2: Multi-Turn Inquiry Leading to Action)**

*   **Alex (User) Types:** `Thanks. I'm also going on vacation soon. What's the policy for pausing my membership?`

*   **Presenter:** "Now, let's ask a more complex question that might lead to an action."

*   **Expected Outcome (AI Response):** `According to our policies, to place a membership on hold, you must provide at least 7 days' notice. Holds can be set for a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of three months. A small holding fee may apply depending on your membership tier.`

*   **Presenter:** "Again, a perfect, policy-based answer. But here's where Orchestrate changes the game. I don't have to go anywhere else."

**(Step 3: The Transactional Command - The "Wow" Moment)**

*   **Alex (User) Types:** `Okay, that works. Please put my All Access membership on hold for two weeks, starting next Monday.`

*   **Presenter:** "This is the critical step. I've given it a complex command with multiple pieces of information: the action (put on hold), the duration (two weeks), and the start date (next Monday). The Supervisor agent understands this is a job for the Action Specialist."

*   **Expected Outcome (AI Response):** `Got it. I am placing a two-week hold on your All Access membership, starting on Monday, September 22nd, 2025. Can you please confirm?`

*   **Alex (User) Types:** `Yes, confirm.`

*   **Expected Outcome (AI Response):** `Your membership hold has been successfully processed. Your confirmation ID is HOLD-XYZ123. Your membership will automatically reactivate on Monday, October 6th, 2025. Enjoy your vacation!`

*   **Presenter:** "And just like that, the entire task is complete. No emails, no waiting, no burden on your staff. Alex's need was resolved in seconds. This is the power of moving from informational to transactional AI."

### **Section 5: How It Works - A Quick Look Under the Hood (3 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Demystify the Technology:** Show that this isn't "magic." It's built with transparent, manageable components using the Agent Development Kit (ADK).
*   **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Briefly display the key YAML and Python files.
*   **Emphasize Simplicity and Control:** Highlight how easy it is to add knowledge, define tools, and orchestrate agents.

**(Script)**

"What we just saw feels powerful, but I want to quickly show you how achievable it is with the watsonx Orchestrate ADK.

1.  **The Knowledge Base:** *(Show the `studio_knowledge_base.yaml` file)*. To teach the AI your policies, we don't write complex rules. We simply create a knowledge base and point it to your existing documents—text files, PDFs, etc. It's that easy to keep the AI's knowledge up-to-date.

2.  **The Tools:** *(Show the `member_tools.py` file, highlighting the `@tool` decorator and function name `place_membership_on_hold`)*. To give the AI the ability to *act*, our developers define simple Python functions. This `place_membership_on_hold` function is what connects to your membership system's API to perform the action. The `@tool` decorator makes it available to the agent. This is secure, version-controlled, and fully customizable.

3.  **The Supervisor:** *(Show the `StudioConciergeAgent.yaml` file, highlighting the `collaborators` section)*. Finally, this simple YAML file defines our main agent. You can see here in the `collaborators` section, we've simply listed the two specialist agents. The supervisor's underlying language model uses these descriptions to intelligently route the work.

The ADK provides a clear, code-based framework that gives your development team full control and transparency."

### **Section 6: Business Value & Return on Investment (2 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Tie it Back to Business Goals:** Connect the technology directly to CPY's objectives.
*   **Quantify the Benefits:** Use concrete examples of value.
*   **Summarize the "Why":** Reiterate the three core pillars of value.

**(Script)**

"So, what does this mean for Core Power Yoga's bottom line? The value is threefold:

1.  **Enhanced Member Experience:** You're providing 24/7, instant, frictionless self-service. This increases member satisfaction and loyalty, directly impacting retention in a competitive market.

2.  **Increased Operational Efficiency:** By automating dozens of daily administrative tasks across your 220+ studios, you empower your staff to focus on what they do best: teaching amazing classes, building personal connections, and driving in-studio retail and teacher training sales. We estimate this could reduce front-desk administrative workload by over 30%.

3.  **Scalable, Consistent Service:** The Studio Concierge AI delivers a perfectly consistent, on-brand experience every single time, at every studio, without needing to train hundreds of employees on every policy nuance.

This isn't just a cost-saving tool; it's a strategic investment in member experience and a force multiplier for your most valuable asset—your people."

### **Section 7: Q&A Preparation (Anticipated Questions)**

**(Be prepared for these common questions)**

*   **Q1: How does this integrate with our existing systems, like our membership management platform?**
    *   **A:** Through the tools we just saw. Our developers would write Python functions that securely call the APIs of your existing systems. watsonx Orchestrate is designed to be the intelligent front-end that connects to any backend with an API, whether it's Salesforce, a custom database, or your booking software.

*   **Q2: How is this different from the Vertex AI agent we're already building?**
    *   **A:** It's the perfect complement. Your Vertex agent is excellent for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—finding answers in documents. Orchestrate incorporates that same RAG capability but adds two crucial layers: **1) Action-taking tools** to execute transactions, and **2) A supervisor agent** to manage complex, multi-step tasks that require both information and action. You can even import your existing agent as a collaborator within Orchestrate.

*   **Q3: How do we ensure the AI is secure and doesn't perform unauthorized actions?**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. The ADK has built-in controls like `ToolPermission`, allowing you to define who can use which tools. All API connections and credentials are managed securely within the IBM Cloud environment, which is built for the enterprise. We are not giving the AI general access; we are giving it explicit permission to use specific, pre-defined tools.

### **Section 8: Next Steps & Call to Action (1 minute)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Summarize the Core Message:** Reiterate the journey from informational to transactional AI.
*   **Propose a Concrete Next Step:** Make it easy for them to say "yes."

**(Script)**

"Today, we've shown how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can take your AI strategy to the next level—transforming your member services from a simple Q&A function into a fully automated, transactional experience.

The logical next step is to make this real for you. We'd like to propose a two-hour, hands-on workshop with your technical team. In that session, we can build a working proof-of-concept of the `place_membership_on_hold` use case, connecting it to a test environment of your systems.

Thank you again for your time. I'll now open it up for any further questions."
