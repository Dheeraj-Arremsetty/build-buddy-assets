# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan for Global Finance Corp

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for creating an IBM watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for **Global Finance Corp**. The demo addresses the client's key challenge: automating the complex, manual, and error-prone process of investigating and resolving high-value anomalous financial transactions. Currently, this process requires coordination across Fraud Detection, Compliance, and Customer Relations teams, leading to delays and operational risk.

The proposed solution implements a sophisticated, multi-agent architecture. A central **Supervisor Agent** orchestrates the entire workflow by delegating specific tasks to specialized **Collaborator Agents**. These agents leverage a suite of custom tools to gather data, perform analysis, check against regulatory knowledge bases, and generate communications. This demo will showcase how watsonx Orchestrate can create a robust, auditable, and efficient "digital labor" pattern to streamline critical cross-departmental business processes, directly aligning with Global Finance Corp's need for enhanced operational efficiency and compliance.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK Installed**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed and configured in your Python environment.
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate[adk]"
    ```
2.  **Environment Configuration**: Your Orchestrate environment must be properly configured. You should be able to connect to your watsonx Orchestrate instance using the CLI.
    ```bash
    # Run this command and follow the prompts to log in
    orchestrate login
    ```
3.  **Python Environment**: A Python 3.9+ environment is required to create the custom tools.
4.  **Project Directory**: A dedicated directory to store all the configuration files, tools, and knowledge base documents for this demo.

## Step 1: Define the Project Structure

First, create a clear and organized directory structure for all the demo assets. This ensures that all components are easy to manage and import.

```bash
# Create the main project directory
mkdir global_finance_demo
cd global_finance_demo

# Create subdirectories for agents, tools, and the knowledge base
mkdir agents
mkdir tools
mkdir -p knowledge_base/documents
```

This structure will house all the YAML configuration files for agents, Python files for tools, and the source documents for our knowledge base.

## Step 2: Create the Knowledge Base

The Compliance agent will need to reference internal policies and external regulations. We will create a knowledge base using documents that the agent can search to answer compliance-related questions.

### 2.1. Create Mock Regulatory Documents

For the demo, we need some source documents. Create two empty PDF files inside the `knowledge_base/documents/` directory. While these files will be empty for the demo setup, in a real scenario, they would contain the actual policy text.

```bash
touch knowledge_base/documents/aml_policy_v1.pdf
touch knowledge_base/documents/kyc_guidelines_v2.pdf
```

### 2.2. Define the Knowledge Base YAML

Create a YAML file named `regulatory_kb.yaml` inside the `knowledge_base/` directory. This file defines the knowledge base, points to the source documents, and specifies the embedding model to use for vectorization.

**File:** `knowledge_base/regulatory_kb.yaml`
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: knowledge_base 
name: regulatory_kb
description: >
   Contains information about Global Finance Corp's internal Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies and Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. This knowledge base is used to verify transaction compliance against established financial regulations.
documents:
   - "knowledge_base/documents/aml_policy_v1.pdf"
   - "knowledge_base/documents/kyc_guidelines_v2.pdf"
vector_index:
   embeddings_model_name: ibm/slate-125m-english-rtrvr-v2
```

## Step 3: Create Python Tools

The agents will use a set of Python-based tools to perform their tasks. These tools simulate interactions with various financial systems by generating realistic synthetic data. We will group related tools into logical Python files.

### 3.1. Create `requirements.txt`

Before creating the tools, create a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your project directory. This file will list any external Python libraries your tools depend on. For this demo, we'll include `python-dotenv` as a best practice, even though our mock tools have no external dependencies.

**File:** `requirements.txt`
```text
python-dotenv
```

### 3.2. Financial and Fraud Analysis Tools

These tools are responsible for fetching transaction data and performing a preliminary fraud analysis.

**Business Value:** This toolset automates the initial data gathering and risk assessment steps, which are often manual and time-consuming for fraud analysts. It provides immediate, data-driven insights, allowing analysts to focus on high-risk cases.

**File:** `tools/financial_tools.py`
```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="get_
