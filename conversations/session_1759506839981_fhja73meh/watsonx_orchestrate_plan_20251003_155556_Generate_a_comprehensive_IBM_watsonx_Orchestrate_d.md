# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: "Empower" Agent for Employee Success

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building and deploying a sophisticated, multi-agent solution within IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The plan is tailored to address a common enterprise challenge: providing a unified, intelligent, and efficient support system for employees. We will create the "Empower" agent, a central supervisor that acts as a single point of contact for employees, intelligently orchestrating tasks across different business domains like Human Resources (HR) and IT support.

The "Empower" agent will leverage two specialized collaborator agents: a "Customer Care" agent for handling healthcare and benefits inquiries, and a "ServiceNow" agent for managing IT support incidents. This hierarchical structure demonstrates the power of watsonx Orchestrate to break down complex business processes into modular, manageable components. The solution will also incorporate a knowledge base to answer general policy questions, showcasing a complete, 360-degree approach to enterprise automation. This demo will prove how watsonx Orchestrate can streamline operations, reduce response times, and significantly improve the employee experience by integrating disparate systems through a conversational AI interface.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is correctly configured.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Account**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate account with access to the Agent Builder.
2.  **Python Environment**: A working Python environment (version 3.10 or later) is required.
3.  **watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed. If not, install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate[all]"
    ```
4.  **ADK Authentication**: You must be logged into your watsonx Orchestrate environment via the CLI.
    ```bash
    orchestrate login
    ```
    Follow the prompts to authenticate your session.
5.  **Project Structure**: Create a dedicated directory for this project to keep all files organized.

    ```bash
    mkdir empower-demo
    cd empower-demo
    mkdir -p agents tools/customer_care tools/service_now knowledge_base/documents
    ```

## Step 1: Create the Tools

Tools are the foundational components that perform actions. We will create Python-based tools with realistic synthetic data to simulate interactions with backend HR and IT systems.

### 1.1 Customer Care Tools

These tools simulate interactions with a healthcare benefits system.

#### `tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py`

This tool retrieves detailed information about various healthcare plans. It's essential for helping employees understand their coverage options, compare plans, and make informed decisions about their health benefits. By automating this data retrieval, the agent reduces the burden on HR staff and provides instant, accurate information to employees.

```python
# tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py
import json
from enum import Enum
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

class Plan(str, Enum):
    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'
    PPO = 'PPO'

@tool
def get_healthcare_benefits(plan: Plan, in_network: bool = None):
    """Retrieves a comprehensive list of health benefits data, organized by coverage type and plan variant.

    This data includes details such as annual deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and various co-pays or
    percentages for medical services under different network plans (HDHP, HDHP Plus, and PPO).

    Args:
        plan (Plan): The plan the user is currently on. Can be one of "HDHP", "HDHP Plus", or "PPO".
        in_network (bool, optional): Whether the user wants coverage for in-network or out-of-network.
            If not provided, both will be returned.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains details about benefit coverage.
    """
    # In a real-world scenario, this would call a secure API.
    # For this demo, we generate synthetic data.
    benefits_data = [
        {"Coverage": "Annual Deductible", "HDHP (In-Network)": "$3,000", "HDHP (Out-of-Network)": "$6,000", "HDHP Plus (In-Network)": "$2,000", "HDHP Plus (Out-of-Network)": "$4,000", "PPO (In-Network)": "$1,000", "PPO (Out-of-Network)": "$2,000"},
        {"Coverage": "Out-of-Pocket Maximum", "HDHP (In-Network)": "$6,000", "HDHP (Out-of-Network)": "$12,000", "HDHP Plus (In-Network)": "$4,000", "HDHP Plus (Out-of-Network)": "$8,000", "PPO (In-Network)": "$3,000", "PPO (Out-of-Network)": "$6,000"},
        {"Coverage": "Preventive Services", "HDHP (In-Network)": "100%", "HDHP (Out-of-Network)": "70%", "HDHP Plus (In-Network)": "100%", "HDHP Plus (Out-of-Network)": "80%", "PPO (In-Network)": "100%", "PPO (Out-of-Network)": "80%"},
        {"Coverage": "Primary Care Visit", "HDHP (In-Network)": "20% after deductible", "HDHP (Out-of-Network)": "40% after deductible", "HDHP Plus (In-Network)": "$30 copay", "HDHP Plus (Out-of-Network)": "40% after deductible", "PPO (In-Network)": "$25 copay", "PPO (Out-of-Network)": "40% after deductible"},
        {"Coverage": "Specialist Visit", "HDHP (In-Network)": "20% after deductible", "HDHP (Out-of-Network)": "40% after deductible", "HDHP Plus (In-Network)": "$50 copay", "HDHP Plus (Out-of-Network)": "40% after deductible", "PPO (In-Network)": "$50 copay", "PPO (Out-of-Network)": "40% after deductible"},
        {"Coverage": "Emergency Room", "HDHP (In-Network)": "20% after deductible", "HDHP (Out-of-Network)": "20% after deductible", "HDHP Plus (In-Network)": "$250 copay", "HDHP Plus (Out-of-Network)": "$250
