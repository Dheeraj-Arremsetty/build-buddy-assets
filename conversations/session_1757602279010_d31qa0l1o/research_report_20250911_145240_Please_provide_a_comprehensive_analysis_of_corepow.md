### **CorePower Yoga: A Strategic Analysis**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

### **1.0 Executive Summary**

CorePower Yoga (CPY) is the largest yoga studio chain in the United States, positioning itself as a leader in the premium boutique fitness industry. The company operates on a hybrid model, combining a vast network of physical studios with a robust digital platform. After navigating a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020, triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, CPY has re-emerged under the ownership of private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners with a stabilized financial outlook.

The company's revenue is driven by a mix of recurring memberships, class packages, digital subscriptions, and ancillary services like teacher training. While its core offering remains intense, in-studio yoga classes, its digital platform, "Yoga on Demand," has become a critical component of its strategy.

In a significant technological step, CorePower is leveraging Google Cloud's AI, specifically Agent Builder, to enhance operational efficiency by automating customer service. This internal-facing AI strategy contrasts with key competitors like Peloton, Alo Moves, and Lululemon Studio, which are using generative AI for customer-facing applications such as workout personalization and real-time form correction. This analysis suggests that while CorePower's current AI focus is a pragmatic step toward improving efficiency, a future evolution toward personalized member experiences will be crucial to maintaining its competitive edge.

### **2.0 Industry and Market Positioning**

#### **2.1 Primary Industry**
CorePower Yoga operates primarily within the **boutique fitness industry**, a segment of the broader health and wellness market. This sector is characterized by specialized, class-based workout experiences that foster a sense of community and brand loyalty, often at a premium price point. CPY's specific niche is the **yoga studio market**, where it has established a dominant presence. The company also competes in the rapidly growing **digital fitness and wellness sub-industry** through its on-demand and live-streamed class offerings.

#### **2.2 Market Position**
CorePower Yoga is widely recognized as the **market leader in the U.S. yoga studio sector** based on its national scale. Prior to its 2020 bankruptcy, the company operated over 200 studios across the country, a footprint unmatched by any direct competitor (Source 4). Its post-restructuring focus has been on optimizing this footprint and integrating its physical and digital offerings.

#### **2.3 Competitive Differentiation**
CPY differentiates itself through several key factors:

*   **Standardized, Athletic Style:** Unlike traditional yoga studios that may vary widely in style, CorePower offers a consistent and physically intense, vinyasa-based workout, often in a heated environment. Signature classes like "Yoga Sculpt" incorporate weights, blending yoga with strength training to appeal to a broader fitness audience (Source 2).
*   **National Scale and Brand Recognition:** Its extensive network of studios provides brand consistency and convenience for members who travel, creating a powerful network effect that smaller, independent studios cannot replicate.
*   **Hybrid Business Model:** The integration of its in-studio experience with its "Yoga on Demand" digital platform allows CPY to serve members both in-person and at home. This hybrid approach, accelerated by the pandemic, has become a core part of its value proposition (Source 3).
*   **Community and Lifestyle Brand:** CPY cultivates a strong sense of community through its studios, teacher training programs, and lifestyle branding, which fosters high member retention.

### **3.0 Financial Status**

#### **3.1 Financial Health and Ownership**
CorePower Yoga's recent financial history is defined by its 2020 Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2020, citing the "devastating impact" of mandatory studio closures during the COVID-19 pandemic (Source 4). At the time of the filing, the company had an estimated $125 million in funded debt.

The company successfully emerged from bankruptcy in December 2020 under the new ownership of **TSG Consumer Partners**, a private equity firm that was previously a lender (Source 5). This transition provided CPY with a healthier balance sheet and the capital to reinvest in its business. As a privately held company, detailed current financials are not public, but its continued operations and strategic initiatives, such as its investment in AI, indicate a stabilized and forward-looking financial position.

#### **3.2 Funding and Valuation**
Current funding is provided by its private equity owner, TSG Consumer Partners. No recent public valuation figures are available. However, TSG's continued investment underscores confidence in CPY's business model and its leadership position in the boutique fitness market.

### **4.0 Revenue Generation**

CorePower Yoga employs a diversified revenue model centered on memberships and class-based services.

*   **Primary Income Streams:**
    *   **Memberships:** The core of CPY's revenue is its recurring membership model. The "All Access Membership" provides unlimited access to all studios nationwide and its digital platform, representing the highest-tier offering. Studio-specific passes are also available.
    *   **Class Packages:** For customers seeking more flexibility, CPY sells packs of 5, 10, or 20 classes that can be used over a longer period.
    *   **Digital Subscriptions:** The "Yoga on Demand" platform is offered as a standalone subscription, providing a steady stream of digital-only revenue.
*   **Ancillary Revenue Streams:**
    *   **Teacher Training:** CPY runs highly regarded and intensive teacher training programs (200-hour and 300-hour), which represent a significant, high-margin revenue source.
    *   **Retail:** Studios sell branded apparel, yoga mats, towels, and other accessories, adding an additional layer of revenue and brand marketing.
    *   **Workshops and Retreats:** Specialized workshops and wellness retreats provide premium, one-time revenue opportunities.

### **5.0 Offerings: Service-Based vs. Digital**

CorePower has strategically evolved into a hybrid company, balancing its traditional in-studio services with a comprehensive digital platform.

#### **5.1 Service-Based Offerings (In-Studio)**
The in-person studio experience remains the cornerstone of the CorePower brand.
*   **Core Classes:** These include a range of signature classes like *CorePower Yoga 2 (C2)*, an athletic vinyasa class in a heated room, and *Yoga Sculpt*, a high-energy class incorporating free weights and cardio.
*   **Community and Environment:** The physical studios are designed to be modern, clean, and community-oriented, offering amenities like showers and retail boutiques. This environment is a key part of the premium customer experience.

#### **5.2 Digital Products**
Accelerated by the pandemic, CPY's digital offerings provide flexibility and accessibility.
*   **CorePower Yoga on Demand:** A subscription-based platform featuring a library of hundreds of pre-recorded classes of varying styles, lengths, and difficulty levels.
*   **Live-Streamed Classes (Live):** Subscribers can join real-time classes streamed from CPY studios, offering an interactive experience from home. This feature directly competes with other live-stream fitness platforms (Source 3).

### **6.0 AI Strategy: Focus on Operational Efficiency**

CorePower Yoga's current AI strategy is centered on improving internal operations and customer service efficiency through its partnership with Google Cloud.

*   **Challenge:** CPY faced a high volume of repetitive customer inquiries across phone, email, and chat regarding memberships, class schedules, and studio policies. This placed a significant strain on its human customer service agents.
*   **Solution:** The company implemented **Google Cloud's Agent Builder**, a generative AI platform, to create a sophisticated chatbot for its website (Source 6).
*   **Implementation:** The AI agent was trained on CPY's own extensive knowledge base, including its website content and help center articles. This allows the AI to understand and respond to a wide range of natural language queries with accurate, company-specific information.
*   **Strategic Goal:** The primary objective is **operational efficiency**. By automating responses to common questions, the AI agent provides 24/7 support, delivers instant answers to customers, and frees up human agents to focus on more complex, high-value interactions. This is a pragmatic, cost-saving application of AI designed to enhance the customer experience by improving response times and availability.

### **7.0 Competitor AI Innovation: Focus on Personalization**

While CorePower focuses its AI on operational efficiency, its key competitors—particularly those that are digitally native—are leveraging generative AI for direct product enhancement and personalization.

*   **Key Competitors:**
    *   **Digital Yoga/Wellness:** Alo Moves, Glo
    *   **Connected Fitness:** Peloton, Lululemon Studio (formerly Mirror), Apple Fitness+

*   **Competitor AI Applications:**
    *   **Alo Moves:** Uses AI to provide personalized class recommendations. The platform's algorithm analyzes a user's practice history, stated goals, and preferences to curate a unique daily class plan, enhancing user engagement and retention (Source 8).
    *   **Lululemon Studio:** The Lululemon Studio Mirror is a prime example of integrated AI. It uses computer vision (a subset of AI) and embedded cameras to provide real-time form correction and track biometric data. This creates a highly personalized and interactive workout experience that mimics having a personal trainer (Source 9).
    *   **Peloton & Apple Fitness+:** These platforms heavily leverage AI and machine learning to power their recommendation engines. They analyze user performance data, class ratings, and workout history to suggest new classes and programs, driving discovery and keeping users engaged with their vast content libraries (Source 7).

### **8.0 Analysis and Conclusion**

CorePower Yoga has successfully navigated a significant financial crisis to reassert its dominance in the physical yoga studio market while building a complementary digital presence. Its current AI strategy reflects a pragmatic and foundational approach: using proven technology like Google's Agent Builder to solve a clear business problem—customer service inefficiency. This move strengthens its operational backbone and improves the customer support experience.

However, a clear divergence exists between CorePower's AI strategy and that of its most technologically advanced competitors. While CPY is using AI for **internal efficiency**, competitors like Lululemon Studio and Alo Moves are using it for **external-facing product personalization**. They are creating "smarter" fitness products that adapt to the individual user, a powerful value proposition in a crowded market.

**Strategic Outlook:** CorePower's current AI implementation is a logical first step. The long-term opportunity lies in bridging this strategic gap. By leveraging the vast amount of data collected from its millions of members—both from in-studio attendance and digital platform usage—CorePower is well-positioned to develop its own personalization engine. Future applications could include:

*   Recommending specific in-studio classes based on a member's digital practice history.
*   Creating personalized class plans on its On Demand platform.
*   Using data to optimize class schedules and formats at physical studios.

To maintain its leadership and effectively compete with digitally native fitness brands, CorePower's evolution from using AI for efficiency to using it for a deeply personalized member experience will be a critical next step.
