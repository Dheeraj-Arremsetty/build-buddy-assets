  A specialized agent responsible for regulatory compliance verification within the [DOMAIN] sector. This agent analyzes processed data to ensure it adheres to established industry regulations and internal policies. It can check against known compliance rules, assess data for potential risks, and generate a risk score. Its purpose is to provide an automated governance check, flagging any transactions or data points that may require further human review.
