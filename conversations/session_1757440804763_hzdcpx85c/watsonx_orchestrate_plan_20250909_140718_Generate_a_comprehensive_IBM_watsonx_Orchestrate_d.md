# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan for [CLIENT_NAME]

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for developing and deploying a sophisticated multi-agent system using IBM watsonx Orchestrate, tailored specifically to [CLIENT_NAME]'s business needs. The objective is to demonstrate how Orchestrate can automate complex, multi-stage business processes, from initial data collection and processing to in-depth analysis, compliance verification, and final reporting.

The proposed solution architecture consists of a supervisor agent that orchestrates a team of specialized collaborator agents. Each collaborator agent is equipped with a set of powerful, custom-built tools to perform its designated function. This hierarchical structure mirrors a human operational team, enabling the system to handle intricate workflows, ensure data integrity, and deliver actionable insights. By implementing this plan, [CLIENT_NAME] will gain a powerful, scalable Digital Labor solution that enhances operational efficiency, improves decision-making, and ensures regulatory compliance within their [DOMAIN] operations.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the implementation, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements. This setup is crucial for a smooth development and deployment process using the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK).

1.  **Python Environment**: An installation of Python 3.10 or higher is required. You can verify your version by running `python --version`.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit must be installed. This provides the necessary CLI and Python libraries to build and manage agents and tools. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **Active Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. This involves initializing the environment and logging in to your account. If you haven't done so, run:
    ```bash
    orchestrate login
    ```
    Follow the prompts to authenticate your session. This ensures that all agents and tools are imported into the correct tenant.
4.  **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated directory for this project to keep all configuration files and code organized. We recommend the following structure:
    ```
    /client-demo-project
    |-- /agents
    |   |-- supervisor_agent.yaml
    |   |-- data_collection_agent.yaml
    |   |-- data_processing_agent.yaml
    |   |-- insight_generation_agent.yaml
    |   |-- compliance_agent.yaml
    |   |-- reporting_agent.yaml
    |-- /tools
    |   |-- data_collection_tools.py
    |   |-- data_processing_tools.py
    |   |-- insight_generation_tools.py
    |   |-- compliance_tools.py
    |   |-- reporting_tools.py
    |-- requirements.txt
    ```

## Step 1: Define the Agent Architecture (YAML Configurations)

This step involves creating the YAML configuration files for each agent in the proposed architecture. These files define the agent's identity, behavior, instructions, and its relationships with tools and other agents.

### 1.1 Reporting Agent

The `reporting_agent` is responsible for the final step of the workflow: consolidating all processed data and generated insights into a clear, structured, and comprehensive summary report. This agent ensures that the final output is easy to understand for business stakeholders, providing a complete picture of the analysis performed.

**File:** `agents/reporting_agent.yaml`
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: reporting_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  An agent specializing in generating comprehensive summary reports. It takes processed data, analytical insights, and compliance verification results to create a structured, human-readable report suitable for business stakeholders. This agent is the final step in the workflow, responsible for presenting the complete findings of the automated business process. It is skilled at organizing complex information into clear sections, including an executive summary, key findings, and detailed data breakdowns.
instructions: >
  Your primary function is to generate a final summary report.
  1.  Receive the processed data, insights, and compliance status from the supervisor.
  2.  Use the `generate_summary_report` tool to structure and format this information.
  3.  Ensure the report includes an executive summary, key findings, and a data appendix.
  4.  The tone should be professional and objective.
  5.  Return the final, formatted report as a single string. Do not attempt to perform any analysis yourself; your role is strictly presentation.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - generate_summary_report
```

### 1.2 Compliance Agent

The `compliance_agent` plays a critical role in ensuring that all operations and data adhere to the relevant [DOMAIN] regulations. It uses its tools to check data against a set of predefined compliance rules and generates a risk score, flagging any potential issues for review. This provides an essential governance layer within the automated process.

**File:** `agents/compliance_agent.yaml`
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: compliance_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  A specialized agent responsible for regulatory compliance verification within the [DOMAIN] sector. This agent analyzes processed data to ensure it adheres to established industry regulations and internal policies. It can check against known compliance rules, assess data for potential risks, and generate a risk score. Its purpose is to provide an automated governance check, flagging any transactions or data points that may require further human review.
instructions: >
  You are a compliance officer. Your task is to verify data against regulatory standards.
  1.  You will be given a set of processed data.
  2.  Use the `check_compliance_regulations` tool to validate the data against a list of predefined [DOMAIN] rules.
  3.  Next, use the `generate_risk_score` tool to calculate a risk assessment score based on the compliance check.
  4.  Return both the compliance status (pass/fail with details) and the calculated risk score.
  5.  Do not make any business recommendations; your focus is solely on compliance verification.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - check_compliance_regulations
  - generate_risk_score
```

### 1.3 Insight Generation Agent

The `insight_generation_agent` is the analytical core of the system. It takes cleaned and processed data and applies its analytical tools to uncover trends, anomalies, and actionable insights. This agent translates raw data into business intelligence, helping stakeholders understand market dynamics and make informed decisions.

**File:** `agents/insight_generation_agent.yaml`
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: insight_generation_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  An analytical agent designed to uncover actionable insights from processed data. This agent specializes in trend analysis, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling. It uses its tools to analyze structured data sets, identify significant patterns, and generate forward-looking recommendations. This agent is crucial for transforming raw data into strategic business intelligence, helping to answer questions about market trends, operational performance, and future opportunities.
instructions: >
  You are a data analyst. Your goal is to find meaningful patterns in the data.
  1.  You will receive a structured dataset that has already been processed.
  2.  Use the `analyze_market_trends` tool to identify key trends, growth patterns, and outliers in the data.
  3.  Synthesize the findings from the tool into a concise summary of insights.
  4.  Provide actionable recommendations based on the identified trends.
  5.  Return a structured object containing the key trends, a summary, and your recommendations.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - analyze_market_trends
```

### 1.4 Data Processing Agent

The `data_processing_agent` acts as the data engineer of the group. It takes raw data collected from various sources and is responsible for cleaning, transforming, and structuring it for analysis. This agent ensures data quality and consistency, which is a critical prerequisite for reliable analysis and insight generation.

**File:** `agents/data_processing_agent.yaml`
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: data_processing_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  A data engineering agent that specializes in cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw data. This agent takes data from various sources and prepares it for analysis. Its responsibilities include handling missing values, standardizing formats, aggregating data, and ensuring data quality. It is a foundational agent in the workflow, ensuring that all subsequent analysis is performed
