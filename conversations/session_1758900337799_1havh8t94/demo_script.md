### **Section 1: Introduction & The Strategic Imperative (2 minutes)**

**Presenter:** Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I’m a specialist with IBM watsonx Orchestrate.

**Talking Points:**

*   **Acknowledge Their World:** "We've been closely following Xerox's journey and have reviewed your strategic analysis. It's clear you're in a pivotal moment—managing a highly successful legacy business while aggressively expanding into digital services, IT services, and AI-enabled platforms like your own Agent Builder. This transformation is exciting, but we know it presents significant operational challenges."
*   **Frame the Conversation:** "Today, we're not just going to talk about technology. We're going to talk about a strategic enabler for this transformation. Specifically, how you can empower your sales teams—the very people on the front lines of selling this new digital portfolio—to be more productive, data-driven, and effective."
*   **State the Goal:** "Our goal is to show you how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can create an AI-powered digital teammate for your sales organization, automating the complex, time-consuming tasks that get in the way of what they do best: building relationships and closing deals."

### **Section 2: The Modern Seller's Dilemma: The QBR & Proposal Grind (3 minutes)**

**Presenter:** Every successful sales organization relies on strategic client engagement, and Quarterly Business Reviews are the cornerstone of that. But the preparation is a major productivity drain.

**Talking Points:**

*   **The Pain Point (Relate to Xerox):** "For a company with a diverse portfolio like Xerox—spanning print, managed services, software, and AI platforms—preparing for a QBR or drafting a complex proposal is a massive manual effort. Your sellers are likely spending hours, or even days, navigating a maze of systems."
*   **Illustrate the Manual Process:**
    *   "They log into **Salesforce** to pull account history and open opportunities."
    *   "They pivot to **SAP** to check on past orders and contract statuses."
    *   "They might need to access a **marketing platform** to see recent campaign engagement."
    *   "And they're constantly digging through product documentation or SharePoint to find the latest specs, case studies, or legal clauses for your new digital offerings."
*   **The Business Cost (The "So What?"):**
    *   **Productivity Loss:** "Industry studies show that sellers spend less than a third of their time actually selling. The rest is spent on administrative tasks like this. For Xerox, that's time not spent cross-selling your high-growth IT and Digital Services."
    *   **Risk of Errors:** "This manual 'copy-paste' process is prone to errors. An outdated price or an incorrect product detail in a proposal can damage credibility and slow down the sales cycle."
    *   **Inconsistent Insights:** "Each seller prepares their data slightly differently, leading to inconsistent QBRs and a fragmented view of the customer across the organization."

### **Section 3: The Solution: Your AI-Powered Digital Teammate (3 minutes)**

**Presenter:** Imagine if you could give every salesperson a dedicated assistant—a digital teammate—that does all that data gathering and document drafting for them. That's what we build with watsonx Orchestrate.

**Talking Points:**

*   **Introduce the `Sales_Assistant_Agent`:** "We've used watsonx Orchestrate to build a `Sales_Assistant_Agent`. This isn't just a chatbot; it's a sophisticated AI agent that works just like a human assistant. It understands requests in natural language, uses a set of tools to access your key business systems, and can reason through multi-step tasks to deliver a complete result."
*   **Explain the Supervisor/Collaborator Model (in Business Terms):**
    *   "The `Sales_Assistant_Agent` acts as a **Supervisor**. It's the single point of contact for the salesperson."
    *   "When it receives a request, it delegates tasks to a team of specialized **Collaborator Agents**."
    *   "We have a `Salesforce Agent` that knows how to get CRM data."
    *   "An `SAP Agent` that handles order history."
    *   "And a `Marketing Agent` for engagement stats."
*   **The Value Proposition:** "This multi-agent architecture means you get a secure, scalable, and intelligent digital workforce. Your seller makes one simple request, and their digital teammate orchestrates the entire complex workflow across multiple departments and systems in the background."

### **Section 4: LIVE DEMO: From Request to Insight in Minutes (5 minutes)**

**Presenter:** Excellent. Let's see the `Sales_Assistant_Agent` in action. Here is the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface. I'm playing the role of a salesperson preparing for my QBR with our client, Acme Corp.

**Demo Flow:**

1.  **Step 1: The Natural Language Prompt**
    *   **Action:** In the chat window, type:
        > "Generate a comprehensive QBR briefing document for my upcoming review with Acme Corp. I need their account details from Salesforce, all open opportunities, their complete order history from SAP, and a summary of their recent marketing engagement. Also, draft a preliminary proposal for a 3-year managed print service contract."
    *   **Talking Points:** "Notice I'm not using code or specific commands. I'm speaking naturally, just as I would to a human colleague. I'm asking for data from three different systems and requesting a document to be drafted, all in one go."

2.  **Step 2: The Agent's Reasoning (Show the Execution Plan)**
    *   **Action:** As the agent works, click on the "Show work" or execution trace view.
    *   **Talking Points:** "This is the key differentiator. You're not looking at a black box. Watsonx Orchestrate is showing you its thought process. You can see the **Supervisor Agent** breaking down my request.
        *   *First*, it's calling the `Salesforce Agent` to use the `get_account_details` and `get_open_opportunities` tools.
        *   *Next*, it's tasking the `SAP Agent` to run `get_order_history`.
        *   *Simultaneously*, it's engaging the `Marketing Agent`.
        *   *Finally*, it's using all of this retrieved data as context to generate the proposal draft.
    *   "This transparency is critical for trust, debugging, and governance."

3.  **Step 3: The Consolidated Output**
    *   **Action:** Show the final response from the agent in the chat window. It should be a well-formatted summary.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A markdown-formatted document containing:
        *   **Acme Corp Account Summary:** Owner, Industry, Annual Revenue.
        *   **Open Opportunities:** Table with Opportunity Name, Stage, Amount, Close Date.
        *   **Order History:** List of recent orders from SAP.
        *   **Marketing Engagement:** Summary of recent clicks/opens.
        *   **Proposal Draft:** A link to a newly created document or the text of a draft proposal.
    *   **Talking Points:** "And here we have it. In under a minute, I have a complete, accurate, and consolidated briefing document. What used to take hours of manual work is now done on-demand. My QBR prep is 90% complete."

4.  **Step 4: The Ad-hoc Query (Using the Knowledge Base)**
    *   **Action:** Type a follow-up question:
        > "What are the key features of our new 'QuantumLeap AI' platform? I think Acme might be interested."
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The agent provides a concise summary of the QuantumLeap AI platform's features, pulled directly from the `product_catalog_kb`.
    *   **Talking Points:** "Now, during my prep, a new idea comes to mind. I can ask an ad-hoc question. The agent didn't need to call a system for this; it used its built-in **Knowledge Base**, which we loaded with your product catalog. This allows sellers to get instant, accurate answers about your entire portfolio, especially the new digital offerings they might be less familiar with."

### **Section 5: How It Works: A Look Under the Hood (2 minutes)**

**Presenter:** So, how did we build this? The power lies in the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit, or ADK. This aligns perfectly with your own strategy around the Xerox Agent Builder—empowering your teams to create their own AI solutions.

**Technical Highlights (Keep it high-level):**

*   **Agents (The 'Who'):** "We defined our agents—the Supervisor and Collaborators—in simple YAML files. We gave them names, descriptions, and instructions on how to behave, just like writing a job description for an employee."
*   **Tools (The 'What'):** "The skills our agents use, like `get_account_details`, are built as simple Python functions. The `@tool` decorator makes them instantly available to the agent. You can easily create tools to connect to any API, whether it's a standard SaaS platform or one of Xerox's own internal systems."
*   **Knowledge Base (The 'Knowledge'):** "We created the product knowledge base by simply pointing Orchestrate to a PDF document. It automatically handles the ingestion and vectorization, making that content available for conversational queries."
*   **The Builder Experience:** "Using the ADK, your developers and even business technologists can assemble these components—agents, tools, and knowledge—to build powerful digital teammates for any department, from sales and HR to finance and operations."

### **Section 6: The Business Impact & ROI (2 minutes)**

**Presenter:** Let's bring this back to the business value for Xerox. This is more than just a productivity tool; it's a catalyst for your strategic goals.

*   **Accelerate Sales Cycles:** "By automating proposal and QBR prep, you're not just saving time; you're getting critical information into the hands of your clients faster, reducing friction in the sales process."
*   **Increase Seller Productivity & Focus:**
    *   **Calculation:** "If you give back just **5 hours per week** to each of your enterprise sellers, that's over **200 hours per seller per year**. That's five additional weeks of pure selling time, focused on driving revenue for your new digital services."
*   **Improve Data Accuracy and Trust:** "You ensure every seller is working from a single source of truth, leading to more professional, consistent, and accurate client interactions."
*   **Drive Adoption of New Offerings:** "By embedding product knowledge directly into the seller's workflow, you make it easy for them to confidently talk about and cross-sell your entire portfolio, accelerating the revenue shift from print to digital."

### **Section 7: Q&A Preparation**

**(Anticipated Questions & Prepared Answers)**

1.  **Q: How secure is this? Our CRM and ERP data is highly sensitive.**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. Watsonx Orchestrate does not use your proprietary data to train the base LLMs. Data is passed through secure connectors to the agent for in-context processing only. You maintain full control and ownership of your data, and all interactions can be logged and audited.

2.  **Q: We have several custom, in-house applications. Can Orchestrate connect to those?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely. That's the power of the ADK. If your application has an API, we can create an OpenAPI-based tool. If not, you can build a custom Python tool that uses libraries like Selenium or RPA to interact with it. The platform is designed for extensibility.

3.  **Q: How much effort is it to build and maintain an agent like this?**
    *   **A:** The initial build for an agent like the one we showed can be done in a matter of days or weeks, not months. The low-code/pro-code nature of the ADK empowers your existing IT and development teams. Maintenance is simplified because the tools and agents are modular; you can update one tool (like a change in a Salesforce API) without having to rebuild the entire system.

4.  **Q: Are we locked into using IBM's Granite models?**
    *   **A:** No. Watsonx is an open platform. While our Granite models are optimized for enterprise tasks, Orchestrate allows you to bring your own models or use other leading models available on the watsonx.ai platform. You have the flexibility to choose the best LLM for the job.

### **Section 8: Next Steps & Call to Action (1 minute)**

**Presenter:** What we've shown you today is a powerful example of how to put AI to work in a practical, high-impact way that directly supports Xerox's strategic transformation.

**Call to Action:**

*   "The logical next step is a collaborative **Discovery Workshop**. We would bring our technical experts to meet with your sales operations and IT leaders."
*   "In this session, we can map out a specific QBR or proposal workflow at Xerox and design a tailored Proof of Concept for a `Sales_Assistant_Agent` built on your systems."
*   "Our goal would be to have a working prototype in your hands within a few weeks, demonstrating tangible value to your sales team from day one."

**Closing:**

"Thank you again for your time. We're incredibly excited about the potential to partner with Xerox and help you empower your teams with a true digital workforce."
