## IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: The AI-Powered Contract Automation Suite

**Company:** Box
**Use Case:** End-to-end AI-powered contract lifecycle automation.
**Presenter:** IBM watsonx Orchestrate Specialist
**Total Time:** 18 Minutes

---

### **Part 1: Setting the Stage & Aligning on Strategy (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

*   "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time. We've been following Box's journey closely and are incredibly impressed with your clear vision for the 'Content Cloud.' Your strategic focus on enterprise-grade security, governance, and platform neutrality is a significant differentiator in the market."
*   "We've also studied your AI strategy, particularly the advancements with Box AI and the no-code Agent Builder. It’s clear you understand that the future isn't just about storing content, but about activating it with intelligence to automate work."
*   "Our goal today is not to show you a competing vision, but a complementary one. We want to explore how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can partner with your Content Cloud to solve the complex, cross-application challenges that exist around your core content."
*   "Specifically, we're going to focus on a high-value process we know is critical in regulated industries: the end-to-end contract lifecycle."

### **Part 2: The "Last Mile" Automation Challenge (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

*   "Box has done an exceptional job of creating a secure fortress for enterprise content. A contract is uploaded to Box, and you can be confident it's governed, secure, and compliant."
*   "But the lifecycle of that contract doesn't start or end inside Box. It's a journey that spans multiple systems:"
    *   It might originate from a **Salesforce** opportunity.
    *   It needs review and analysis, often involving legal knowledge bases.
    *   Once approved, it needs to be sent for signature via a tool like **DocuSign**.
    *   After signing, the opportunity in **Salesforce** must be updated to 'Closed Won', and the final document needs to be archived back in **Box** in a specific 'Executed Agreements' folder with the correct metadata.
*   "This is the 'last mile' of automation. It’s the connective tissue between your secure Content Cloud and the rest of the enterprise application landscape. Stitching this together traditionally requires brittle custom code, expensive integration projects, and manual handoffs that introduce delays and risks."
*   "Your Agent Builder is perfect for creating agents that perform tasks *on* your content. The question we want to answer today is: **How do you orchestrate those agents with all the other tools and systems required to complete an entire business process?**"

### **Part 3: Solution Overview: watsonx Orchestrate as the Conductor (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

*   "This is where IBM watsonx Orchestrate comes in. Think of it as the **intelligent conductor** for your entire digital workforce."
*   "While Box AI provides intelligence *within* the Content Cloud, Orchestrate coordinates actions *across* your entire ecosystem. It uses a sophisticated, multi-agent framework to understand a business request and then intelligently delegates tasks to the right specialist."
*   "For our contract use case, we've built a 'Contract Lifecycle Supervisor' agent. This supervisor doesn't do the work itself; it manages a team of collaborators:"
    1.  **A Document Manager Agent:** Its only job is to securely interact with Box—fetching pending contracts and archiving signed ones. This could be an agent you build with your own Agent Builder.
    2.  **A Contract Intelligence Agent:** This agent uses watsonx.ai and a private knowledge base to analyze the contract text, summarize it, and identify risks.
    3.  **A Workflow Execution Agent:** This agent connects to external APIs to perform actions, like updating Salesforce or sending a document via DocuSign.
*   "This multi-agent architecture is built using our **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, which allows your developers to define agents, tools, and knowledge bases using simple Python and YAML. It's designed for rapid, scalable development of enterprise-grade AI automation."
*   "Let's see this in action."

### **Part 4: Live Demo: The Contract Lifecycle in Motion (6 minutes)**

**(Presenter Actions & Narration)**

"I'm now in the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface. I'll be interacting with our supervisor agent, the `Contract Lifecycle Supervisor`, using simple, natural language."

#### **Scenario 1: The "Happy Path" - Standard Contract Automation (2.5 mins)**

*   **Presenter:** "Let's start with a standard, low-risk contract. Imagine I'm a sales ops person ready to finalize a deal."

*   **Action:** Type the following prompt into the chat:
    > **User Prompt:** `"Process the standard MSA for the 'Globex Corp' opportunity, ID 0068e00000kGfA4."`

*   **Presenter:** "I've given the supervisor my intent. Now, watch the 'Thinking' process. It's not just one agent; it's a collaboration."
    *   "First, the Supervisor delegates to the **Document Manager Agent**, which uses its `list_pending_contracts` and `fetch_contract_from_box` tools to securely retrieve the 'Standard_MSA_Template.pdf' from Box."
    *   "Next, the Supervisor passes that document content to the **Contract Intelligence Agent**. This agent uses its `identify_contractual_risks` tool, cross-referencing against our legal knowledge base."

*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds with a message like:
    > **Agent Response:** "I have analyzed the `Standard_MSA_Template.pdf`. The risk analysis indicates 'Low Risk' as it aligns with our standard terms. The key clauses are: [Payment Terms: Net 30], [Governing Law: New York]. Shall I proceed with sending it for signature and updating the Salesforce opportunity?"

*   **Presenter:** "Perfect. The entire initial review is automated. No manual work was needed. I'll confirm."

*   **Action:** Type `Yes, proceed.`

*   **Presenter:** "Now the Supervisor delegates to the **Workflow Execution Agent**. It simulates calling the DocuSign API to send the contract and then calls the Salesforce API to update the opportunity stage. Finally, it will use the Document Manager again to archive the signed copy. The entire lifecycle, from request to completion, is automated in seconds."

#### **Scenario 2: AI-Powered Risk Detection - High-Risk Contract (2.5 mins)**

*   **Presenter:** "That was the easy path. But the real value of AI is in handling exceptions and mitigating risk. Let's try a non-standard agreement."

*   **Action:** Type the following prompt into the chat:
    > **User Prompt:** `"Please analyze the new vendor agreement named 'High_Risk_Vendor_Agreement.pdf' that was just uploaded."`

*   **Presenter:** "The same initial process happens. The Supervisor orchestrates the fetching of the document from Box and passes it to our Intelligence agent for analysis."

*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds with a much different message, highlighting a specific risk.
    > **Agent Response:** "**High Risk Detected.** I have analyzed `High_Risk_Vendor_Agreement.pdf` and found a non-standard clause.
    >
    > *   **Risk Type:** Unlimited Liability
    > *   **Severity:** High
    > *   **Source:** The clause 'The vendor assumes unlimited liability...' was identified.
    > *   **Recommendation:** This deviates from our standard policy. **Requires immediate legal review.** I have not proceeded with the signature process. I can draft an email to the legal team summarizing this finding. Shall I proceed?"

*   **Presenter:** "This is the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in a business process. The agent didn't just find a keyword; it understood the context, checked it against its **legal knowledge base**—which we built from your own internal 'Legal_Risk_Definitions.pdf'—and provided a clear, actionable recommendation. You've just prevented a potentially catastrophic risk from slipping through the cracks, automatically."

#### **Scenario 3: On-Demand Intelligence (1 min)**

*   **Presenter:** "Finally, this system isn't just for linear workflows. It's a powerful assistant for anyone working with your content."

*   **Action:** Type a simple query:
    > **User Prompt:** `"Give me a quick summary of the Simple_NDA.pdf."`

*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent quickly fetches the document and provides a bulleted summary.
    > **Agent Response:** "Certainly. Here is a summary of `Simple_NDA.pdf`:
    > *   Parties Involved: [Party A] and [Party B]
    > *   Purpose: To protect confidential information related to [Project X].
    > *   Term: 5 years from the effective date."

*   **Presenter:** "This shows how the same set of orchestrated agents can provide immediate value for day-to-day tasks, increasing employee productivity by giving them instant answers from your secure content."

### **Part 5: Technical Highlights & Synergy with Box (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

*   "What you just saw was powered by our Agent Development Kit. Let's quickly look at the 'how'."
*   **Show a slide or briefly talk through the YAML/Python code from the Execution Plan.**
*   "**Multi-Agent Architecture:** We defined each agent—the Supervisor, Document Manager, Intelligence, and Workflow—in simple YAML files. The Supervisor's instructions explicitly tell it *who* to delegate to, based on the task. This separation of concerns is a best practice for building robust, scalable AI automation."
*   "**Composable Tools:** Our tools were created in two ways. The Box and AI analysis tools were simple Python functions with an `@tool` decorator. The Salesforce and DocuSign tools were created instantly by importing their existing OpenAPI specifications. This means Orchestrate can connect to virtually any modern application."
*   "**Grounding with Knowledge Bases:** The risk detection was grounded in a knowledge base we created from a single PDF. This ensures the AI's responses are accurate, trustworthy, and based on *your* business rules, not the open internet."
*   "**Synergy with Box Agent Builder:** This is where our strategies converge. You can use your Agent Builder to create powerful, specialized agents that are experts on Box content. You can then register those agents as collaborators in watsonx Orchestrate, allowing a supervisor agent to call upon them as part of a larger, enterprise-wide business process. We provide the orchestration layer to connect your content intelligence to the world of enterprise action."

### **Part 7: Q&A Preparation (Internal Reference)**

*   **Q1: How is this different from what we are building with Box AI and Agent Builder?**
    *   **A:** It's a perfect complement. Box AI excels at generating intelligence *from* the content within your platform. Orchestrate specializes in taking that intelligence and turning it into action *across* other platforms (CRM, ERP, e-signature). Our supervisor agent can orchestrate agents built with your Agent Builder, making them part of a broader enterprise workflow. We provide the "connective tissue."

*   **Q2: How do you handle the security of our content when connecting to these other systems?**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. Orchestrate does not store your content. The `Document Manager Agent` operates by making secure, authenticated API calls to Box, just as any other integrated application would. The content is passed in-memory between agents for the duration of the transaction and is not persisted. All connections to external systems like Salesforce use pre-approved, secure credentials managed within the platform.

*   **Q3: What is the development effort to build a solution like this?**
    *   **A:** The solution you saw was built using our Agent Development Kit with standard Python and YAML. For a developer familiar with these, the learning curve is very gentle. The ability to import OpenAPI specs means connecting to major SaaS platforms can be done in minutes, not weeks. The focus shifts from complex coding to defining the business logic and agent instructions.

*   **Q4: Can the AI models be fine-tuned or customized for our specific legal terminology?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely. The watsonx platform supports fine-tuning models. However, the RAG pattern we showed you with the knowledge base is often a faster and more effective way to customize. By feeding the agent your specific legal definitions, compliance documents, and contract templates, you ground its responses in your reality without the overhead of model retraining.
