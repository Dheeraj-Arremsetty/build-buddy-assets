# Generated deployment script

# Script block 1
pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **Orchestrate Environment Configuration**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured with the ADK. This is typically done via the `orchestrate env add` command, pointing to your tenant credentials.
4.  **Mock Data Files**: You will need to create the mock documents specified in the client demo concept. These files are essential for populating the knowledge base and for the agents to process during the demo scenarios.
5.  **External API Specifications (for production)**: While this plan uses mock OpenAPI specifications for demonstration, a real-world implementation would require the official OpenAPI (or Swagger) specifications for Salesforce and DocuSign to ensure accurate tool creation.

## Step 1: Project Structure and Mock Data Setup
A well-organized project structure is key to managing the different components of your solution. We will also create the necessary mock data files that will be used by our agents and knowledge base.

### 1.1. Create the Project Directory Structure
Create the following folders in your project's root directory:

# Script block 2
# 1. Import the Knowledge Base
echo "Importing knowledge base..."
orchestrate knowledge-bases import -f knowledge-bases/legal_risk_kb.yaml

# 2. Import the Python Tools
echo "Importing Python tools..."
orchestrate tools import -f tools/box_tools.py
orchestrate tools import -f tools/contract_intelligence_tools.py

# 3. Import the OpenAPI Tools
echo "Importing OpenAPI tools..."
orchestrate tools import -f openapi/docusign_api.yaml
orchestrate tools import -f openapi/salesforce_api.yaml

# 4. Import the Collaborator Agents
echo "Importing collaborator agents..."
orchestrate agents import -f agents/document_manager_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f agents/contract_intelligence_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f agents/workflow_execution_agent.yaml

# 5. Import the Supervisor Agent (last)
echo "Importing supervisor agent..."
orchestrate agents import -f agents/contract_lifecycle_supervisor.yaml

echo "All assets imported successfully!"
