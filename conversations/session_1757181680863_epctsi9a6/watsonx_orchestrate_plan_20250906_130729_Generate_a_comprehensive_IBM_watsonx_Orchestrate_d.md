## Execution Plan

# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan

## Overview
This execution plan is designed to create a comprehensive demonstration of IBM watsonx Orchestrate for Xerox's customer support automation. The goal is to automate responses to the most common Xerox printer-related inquiries, thereby enhancing support efficiency and customer satisfaction. By automating 40% of customer support inquiries, we aim to reduce the workload on human agents, provide 24/7 availability, and streamline support processes.

## Prerequisites
1. **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: Ensure that the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) is installed and configured correctly.
2. **Python Environment**: Set up a Python environment with required libraries such as `requests`, `pydantic`, and any additional dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file.
3. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Have access to a terminal or command prompt to execute commands for importing agents and tools.
4. **Text Editor**: Use a text editor like Visual Studio Code for editing YAML and Python files.
5. **Mock Data Sources**: Prepare synthetic data sources, including a mock FAQ database, simulated documentation links, and fake contact information datasets.

## Step 1: Create YAML Configuration

### Xerox Support Agent
This agent is designed to handle common Xerox printer FAQs and simple actions using IBM watsonx Orchestrate's capabilities.

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: xerox_support_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
    An agent that automates responses to the top 5 most common Xerox printer-related inquiries.
instructions: >
    Use the tools provided to respond to FAQs, provide document links, and offer contact information.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - faq_responder
  - document_link_provider
  - contact_info_provider
```

### Explanation
The Xerox Support Agent leverages IBM's LLM to automate responses to frequent queries, reducing human agent workload. It uses tools to fetch FAQs, provide documentation, and contact information, ensuring efficient and effective customer support.

## Step 2: Create Tools

### FAQ Responder Tool

**Python Implementation:**
```python
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission
import json

@tool(name="faq_responder", description="Responds to common Xerox printer FAQs", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def respond_to_faq(question: str) -> str:
    """Provides answers to common Xerox printer-related questions.

    Args:
        question (str): The customer's question.

    Returns:
        str: The response to the FAQ.
    """
    faq_db = {
        "How do I fix a paper jam?": "To fix a paper jam, open the printer cover and gently remove the jammed paper.",
        "What does error code E01 mean?": "Error code E01 indicates a paper feed issue. Please check the paper tray."
    }
    return faq_db.get(question, "I'm sorry, I don't have an answer to that question.")
```

### Explanation
This tool fetches responses for common FAQs from a predefined mock FAQ database. It enhances the agent's ability to provide instant answers to typical customer queries, thus improving response time and customer satisfaction.

### Document Link Provider Tool

**Python Implementation:**
```python
@tool(name="document_link_provider", description="Provides links to Xerox printer manuals and troubleshooting guides", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def provide_document_link(issue: str) -> str:
    """Returns links to documentation relevant to the issue.

    Args:
        issue (str): The issue the customer is facing.

    Returns:
        str: The URL to a relevant document.
    """
    doc_links = {
        "paper jam": "http://xerox.com/manuals/paper-jam-guide.pdf",
        "error code E01": "http://xerox.com/manuals/error-e01-guide.pdf"
    }
    return doc_links.get(issue, "No documentation available for this issue.")
```

### Explanation
This tool provides relevant documentation links to customers, assisting them in resolving issues independently. It supports the agent in delivering comprehensive support beyond just verbal instructions.

### Contact Information Provider Tool

**Python Implementation:**
```python
@tool(name="contact_info_provider", description="Provides contact information for Xerox customer support", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def provide_contact_info() -> str:
    """Returns contact information for further customer support.

    Returns:
        str: The contact information.
    """
    contact_info = "For further support, please contact Xerox Customer Support at 1-800-555-0199 or support@xerox.com."
    return contact_info
```

### Explanation
This tool offers contact details for further assistance, ensuring that customers have all necessary resources to resolve their issues. It enhances the support experience by making additional help readily available.

## Step 3: Import Tools and Agents

### Tool Import Commands
```bash
orchestrate tools import -k python -f faq_responder.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f document_link_provider.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f contact_info_provider.py
```

### Agent Import Command
```bash
orchestrate agents import -f xerox_support_agent.yaml
```

### Explanation
These commands import the tools and agent configurations into the watsonx Orchestrate platform, enabling their functionality in the Xerox support context. Importing ensures that the configurations are recognized and executable by the platform.

## Verification

1. **Test Each Tool Independently**: Execute each tool in isolation to ensure it returns correct and relevant outputs based on the mock data.
2. **Agent Interaction Tests**: Simulate user interactions with the agent and verify that it responds appropriately using the imported tools.
3. **End-to-End Scenario Testing**: Conduct comprehensive tests covering all demo scenarios, including paper jam resolutions, error code explanations, and toner ordering instructions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Agent Import Errors**: Ensure YAML configurations are correctly formatted and paths to files are accurate.
- **Tool Execution Issues**: Check for missing dependencies in the Python environment and ensure all functions are returning expected outputs.
- **Data Retrieval Failures**: Verify that the mock databases and links are correctly set up and accessible.

## Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in tools to manage unexpected inputs gracefully.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure all inputs and outputs are validated for correctness and completeness.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for all configurations and code, facilitating easier troubleshooting and updates.
- **Scalability**: Design tools and configurations with scalability in mind to accommodate future feature expansions and additional FAQs.
