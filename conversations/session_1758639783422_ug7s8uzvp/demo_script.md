## IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: Accelerating Xerox's Reinvention

**Use Case:** HR Talent Acquisition Assistant
**Audience:** Xerox Business & IT Leaders (HR, Operations, Digital Transformation)
**Time Allotment:** 20 Minutes

---

### **Part 1: Setting the Stage (4 minutes)**

**(0:00 - 2:00) | Opening & Company Context**

**Presenter:** "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with the IBM watsonx Orchestrate team.

We've been following Xerox's journey closely, particularly the bold initiatives you've outlined in **'Project Reinvention.'** We understand you're in a pivotal moment, strategically shifting from a legacy leader in print to a comprehensive workplace technology partner. This transformation requires immense agility, operational efficiency, and, most importantly, the right talent to drive growth in your digital and IT services divisions.

Our goal today is not to give you a generic product pitch. It's to show you how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can be a strategic accelerator for 'Project Reinvention' by automating complex work and empowering your teams to focus on what matters most."

**Key Messages:**
*   We understand your business context ("Project Reinvention").
*   We recognize your core challenge: pivoting to digital services while managing costs.
*   We align our solution directly with your strategic goals.

**(2:00 - 4:00) | The Business Challenge: The Talent Acquisition Bottleneck**

**Presenter:** "This strategic pivot puts enormous pressure on every department, but perhaps none more so than Human Resources. To successfully grow your IT and Digital Services, you need to attract and hire top-tier technical and sales talent, and you need to do it faster than your competitors.

Right now, many talent acquisition teams—and we suspect yours is no different—are burdened by high-volume, low-value tasks:
*   Manually sifting through hundreds of resumes for each open role.
*   The endless back-and-forth of coordinating interview schedules across multiple calendars.
*   Fielding repetitive questions from candidates and hiring managers.

This manual effort creates a bottleneck. It slows down your time-to-hire, risks losing top candidates to faster-moving competitors, and pulls your skilled recruiters away from the strategic work they should be doing: building relationships, selling the Xerox vision, and closing top talent.

The very 'AI Agent Builder' you envision as a future product is a concept you can use internally, *today*, to solve these exact problems."

**Key Messages:**
*   Frame the problem around a relatable, critical business function (hiring).
*   Connect the operational pain point directly to the strategic business objective (growth).
*   Use their own language ("AI Agent Builder") to build a bridge to our solution.

### **Part 2: The Solution & Live Demo (9 minutes)**

**(4:00 - 6:00) | Solution Overview: Digital Labor for a Digital-First Xerox**

**Presenter:** "This is precisely where IBM watsonx Orchestrate comes in. It's not just another chatbot or a simple automation tool. It's a **digital labor platform.**

Think of it as providing every employee, department, and team with their own AI assistant. These assistants, or 'agents,' use a combination of language understanding, reasoning, and secure access to your tools and applications to execute complex, multi-step tasks on your behalf.

Today, we're going to build and run a simple **HR Talent Acquisition Assistant**. This agent will be designed to automate the initial, most time-consuming stages of recruitment. It will connect to your applicant data, use AI to screen candidates, and interact with your calendaring system to schedule interviews—all from a simple, natural language request."

**Key Messages:**
*   Introduce the concept of "Digital Labor."
*   Define what an "agent" is in simple terms: Language + Reasoning + Tools.
*   Clearly state the demo's objective.

**(6:00 - 13:00) | Live Demo Flow**

**Presenter:** "Let's see this in action. I'm going to play the role of a busy hiring manager for a new Senior Software Engineer position."

**Step 1: The End-User Experience (The "Magic")**

*   **Action:** Open the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface.
*   **Presenter:** "I'll start by making a request in plain English."
*   **[Type into chat]:** *"Review today's applicants for the Senior Software Engineer role. Identify the top 3 candidates based on experience with Python, cloud services, and AI. Then, schedule a 30-minute intro call with me and each of them for next week."*

*   **Presenter:** "Now, watch what happens. The Orchestrate agent understands this is not a single task, but a sequence of actions."

    1.  **Reasoning:** "First, it confirms the key criteria it needs to use for screening—Python, cloud, and AI."
    2.  **Tool Use 1 (Resume Screener):** "It's now invoking a custom tool we built to parse resume files and score them against those criteria. This could connect to your Applicant Tracking System or even a simple document folder."
    3.  **Tool Use 2 (Calendar):** "Next, it accesses my calendar to find available slots for next week, avoiding conflicts."
    4.  **Interaction:** "It might even ask a clarifying question if needed, like 'I have openings on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Do you have a preference?' For now, we've instructed it to proceed."

*   **Outcome:** The chat displays a concise summary.

    *   `"Okay, I have reviewed the 5 new applicants. Here are the top 3 candidates matching your criteria:`
        *   `1. Jane Doe (Score: 9.2) - Strong Python, 5 years AWS.`
        *   `2. John Smith (Score: 8.8) - Experience with watsonx, 4 years Azure.`
        *   `3. Emily Jones (Score: 8.5) - Python developer, AI/ML project experience.`
    *   `I have sent 30-minute calendar invitations to each candidate and you for next Tuesday. Please check your calendar to confirm."`

*   **Presenter:** "And just like that, a process that would have taken a recruiter hours is done in seconds. The candidates get a faster response, and the hiring manager can prepare for interviews instead of doing admin work."

**Step 2: A Quick Look Under the Hood (The "Making")**

*   **Presenter:** "That was the user experience. Now, how did we build this? This is where the power of the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** comes in. It's designed for your developers to easily create these capabilities."

*   **Action:** Briefly switch to a code editor (like VS Code) showing two simple files.

*   **File 1: `resume_tool.py`**
    *   **Presenter:** "First, we create tools. A tool is just a Python function that performs a specific action. Here's a simplified `resume_screening` tool. Notice the `@tool` decorator? That's all it takes for Orchestrate to recognize this function as a skill it can use. Your developers can use familiar libraries to connect to any API or system you have."

    ```python
    # tools/resume_tool.py
    from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

    @tool
    def screen_resumes(job_description: str, keywords: list) -> str:
        """
        Scans a directory of resumes and returns the top candidates.
        
        Args:
            job_description (str): The role to screen for.
            keywords (list): A list of essential skills to rank.
        
        Returns:
            str: A summary of the top candidates and their scores.
        """
        # In a real scenario, this would connect to an ATS API or file system
        # and use NLP to score documents.
        return "Jane Doe (9.2), John Smith (8.8), Emily Jones (8.5)"
    ```

*   **File 2: `hr_assistant.yaml`**
    *   **Presenter:** "Next, we define the agent itself in a simple configuration file. This is where we give it its personality and capabilities."

    ```yaml
    # agents/hr_assistant.yaml
    spec_version: v1
    kind: native
    name: hr_talent_assistant
    description: An AI assistant for the Xerox HR team that helps screen resumes and schedule interviews.
    llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
    instructions: >
        You are a helpful HR assistant for Xerox.
        Your goal is to make the hiring process fast and efficient.
        When asked to find and schedule candidates, first use the screen_resumes tool.
        Then, use the create_calendar_event tool for each top candidate.
        Always be professional and concise.
    tools:
      - screen_resumes
      - create_calendar_event
    ```

    *   **Presenter:** "We give it a `name`, a `description` so other agents can find it, and simple `instructions` that guide its behavior. Finally, we just list the `tools` it's allowed to use. That's it. We import these files, and the agent is live and ready to work."

### **Part 3: Value and Next Steps (7 minutes)**

**(13:00 - 15:00) | Business Value & ROI for Xerox**

**Presenter:** "Let's bring this back to 'Project Reinvention.' What does this mean for Xerox?"

*   **1. Accelerate Your Transformation:** By automating recruitment, you reduce your time-to-hire by what could be 30-50%. This means getting the critical talent you need to build your digital services business in the door faster, giving you a competitive edge.
*   **2. Drive Operational Efficiency:** This single agent could free up 10-15 hours per week for *each recruiter*. That's time they can reinvest in high-value activities that automation can't replace, directly impacting your bottom line through better hiring outcomes.
*   **3. Empower Your Workforce:** This isn't just for HR. Imagine a Finance Assistant for quarterly reporting, a Sales Assistant to prep for client meetings using your CRM, or an IT Assistant for support tickets. You are empowering your employees with digital labor, making them more productive and engaged.
*   **4. Realize Your AI Vision:** This platform is the engine to build your 'AI Agent Builder' offering for your own customers. By using it internally, you build expertise and create powerful case studies to take to market.

**(15:00 - 17:00) | Technical Highlights & Architecture**

**Presenter:** "For the technical leaders in the room, it's important to know this is a robust, enterprise-grade platform.

*   **Open & Extensible:** The Python-based ADK means you're not locked into proprietary languages. Your teams can build on their existing skills and integrate with any system that has an API.
*   **Hierarchical Agents:** Our HR assistant is simple. But you can build 'supervisor' agents that orchestrate tasks across multiple specialized agents—like an HR supervisor that can call our talent agent, an onboarding agent, and a payroll agent to handle the entire employee lifecycle.
*   **Governance and Security:** Every action is logged, and you have full control over which agents can access which tools and data, ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance.
*   **Powered by watsonx:** The reasoning and language capabilities are powered by IBM's trusted watsonx foundation models, giving you performance you can rely on."

**(17:00 - 19:00) | Preparing for Q&A**

**Presenter:** "I'd like to pause here and open it up for any questions you might have."

**[Anticipated Questions & Prepared Answers]**

*   **Q1: How does this integrate with our existing systems, like our ATS or SAP?**
    *   **A:** "Great question. As long as the system has a REST API, our Python-based tools can connect to it securely. We would simply build a tool that calls the specific API endpoint for, say, 'get new applicants' from your ATS. This allows Orchestrate to act as a universal interface across all your existing enterprise applications."
*   **Q2: How is this different from RPA (Robotic Process Automation)?**
    *   **A:** "RPA is fantastic for automating structured, repetitive, UI-based tasks. Orchestrate is designed for the next level of complexity. It handles unstructured data—like a user's conversational request—and uses AI to reason, make decisions, and dynamically chain multiple tools together to complete a complex goal. Think of RPA for automating clicks, and Orchestrate for automating entire workflows."
*   **Q3: What is the development and deployment lifecycle like?**
    *   **A:** "It's designed to be rapid. As you saw, a simple agent can be defined in a day. Using the ADK, your developers build and test tools locally, then use a command-line interface to import them into your Orchestrate environment. This fits perfectly into modern CI/CD practices, allowing you to iterate and add new skills quickly."
*   **Q4: What about data privacy and security, especially with HR data?**
    *   **A:** "Security is paramount. You have granular control. All data connections are made through the tools you build, using your existing authentication methods like OAuth or API keys. You define which agents can use which tools, ensuring that, for example, only the validated HR agent can access sensitive resume data."

**(19:00 - 20:00) | Next Steps & Call to Action**

**Presenter:** "What we've shown you today is just one example. The real power comes from applying this digital labor pattern to the unique challenges and opportunities within Xerox.

To that end, we propose a concrete next step: a **half-day, hands-on workshop** with your HR and IT teams. In this session, we won't use generic examples. We will take one of your real, time-consuming processes and, together with your team, build a working prototype of a watsonx Orchestrate agent to solve it.

This will give you a tangible feel for the platform's power and a clear business case for moving forward. How does your calendar look for the week of [Suggest a specific week]?"
