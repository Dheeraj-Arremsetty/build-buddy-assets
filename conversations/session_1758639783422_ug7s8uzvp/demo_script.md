## IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: The Xerox Talent Acquisition Assistant

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Demo Specialist Name]
**Audience:** Xerox HR Leadership, Talent Acquisition Team, IT Stakeholders
**Total Time:** 20 Minutes

### **I. Opening & Company Context (2 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Greeting & Acknowledgment:** "Good morning to the Xerox team. Thank you for your time today. We at IBM have been following your journey with great interest, particularly your strategic initiative, 'Project Reinvention.' We understand this is a pivotal moment as you evolve from a leader in print technology to a comprehensive workplace technology and digital services partner."
*   **Align with Their Strategy:** "This transformation isn't just about new products; it's about fundamentally changing how work gets done, both for your customers and internally. Attracting and hiring the right digital-native talent is the fuel for this reinvention. But we know that process can be a significant bottleneck."
*   **Introduce the Vision:** "Today, we're not just going to show you a product. We're going to show you a new way of working. We'll demonstrate how you can build a dedicated AI-powered 'digital teammate' for your talent acquisition team using IBM watsonx Orchestrate, helping you find and hire the best people faster, so you can win in the digital services market."
*   **Agenda:** "We'll briefly touch on the challenges in modern recruiting, then dive into a live demonstration of an AI assistant built for you. We'll look at how it works, discuss the business value, and then open it up for questions."

### **II. The Problem: The Talent Acquisition Bottleneck (2 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Frame the Challenge:** "As Xerox expands into IT and Digital Services, the roles you're hiring for are more competitive than ever. Your recruiters are on the front lines, but they're often buried in high-volume, low-value tasks."
*   **Key Pain Points (Relate to Xerox):**
    *   **Volume Overload:** A single 'Digital Consultant' role can attract hundreds of applications. Manually screening these is incredibly time-consuming and prone to human error.
    *   **Time-to-Fill:** Every day a strategic role sits empty, it impacts your ability to deliver on 'Project Reinvention' goals. The race for talent is won in days, not weeks.
    *   **Inconsistent Screening:** Different recruiters may prioritize different skills, leading to inconsistent candidate quality being passed to busy hiring managers.
    *   **Hiring Manager Disengagement:** Your technical leaders are building Xerox's future; they don't have time to review dozens of mismatched resumes. They need a high-quality, pre-vetted shortlist.
*   **The Business Impact:** "This isn't just an HR problem; it's a business growth problem. Slow hiring stifles innovation, delays projects, and can cause you to lose top candidates to competitors who are moving faster."

### **III. The Solution: watsonx Orchestrate as a Digital Teammate (2 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **Introduce the Concept:** "Imagine giving each of your recruiters a personal assistant—a digital teammate that handles the repetitive, data-intensive parts of their job. That's watsonx Orchestrate. It's a platform for building and running AI-powered assistants that can understand requests, connect to your business systems, and execute complex workflows."
*   **Value Proposition:** "For Xerox, this means we can create a **Talent Acquisition Assistant**. This assistant connects securely to your applicant tracking system (ATS), your HRIS, and your communication tools to automate the entire top-of-funnel recruiting process."
*   **How it Complements Xerox's AI Strategy:** "We see this as a powerful complement to your own **AI Agent Builder**. While your Agent Builder is fantastic for creating bespoke AI agents for specific tasks, Orchestrate provides the enterprise-grade *orchestration layer*. It's the 'central nervous system' that allows different agents and tools to work together, access enterprise data securely, and take action in your core systems."
*   **Set the Stage for the Demo:** "Let's see this in action. We'll follow a recruiter, Sarah, as she uses her new digital teammate to fill a critical role for your new IT Services division."

### **IV. Live Demo: The Talent Acquisition Assistant (8 minutes)**

**(Demo Flow & Script)**

**Presenter:** "Okay, I'm now in the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface. This is the simple, conversational way Sarah, our recruiter, interacts with her digital teammate. She has a new, high-priority requisition for a 'Cloud Solutions Architect'."

**Step 1: The Initial Prompt**
*   **Action:** Type a natural language request into the chat.
    > **"Find and screen the top 5 candidates for the new Cloud Solutions Architect role based in Austin, TX, requisition #78910."**
*   **Talking Points:** "Sarah doesn't need to log into multiple systems. She simply asks Orchestrate in plain English. Now, let's see what the assistant does behind the scenes."

**Step 2: The Agent at Work - Information Gathering**
*   **Expected Outcome:** Orchestrate shows its "thought process" or a log of actions.
*   **Talking Points:** "First, the assistant is invoking a custom tool we built called `get_requisition_details`. This tool securely connects to your ATS—let's say it's Workday—via an API and pulls the full job description, including key skills like 'AWS certification', 'Kubernetes', and 'client-facing experience'."
*   **Presenter:** "Next, it's accessing your candidate database and using a tool called `screen_resumes_against_req`. This is where the AI shines. It's not just keyword matching. It uses a foundation model to understand the *context* and *nuance* of each resume, comparing the candidate's experience directly against the job's core requirements."

**Step 3: The AI-Generated Shortlist**
*   **Expected Outcome:** The chat displays a formatted, ranked list of the top 5 candidates with a "match score" and a brief, one-sentence summary for each.
    *   **1. Priya Sharma (95% Match):** *10+ years in cloud architecture with AWS Pro certification and extensive pre-sales experience.*
    *   **2. Ben Carter (91% Match):** *Strong Kubernetes and enterprise infrastructure background; led three major cloud migration projects.*
    *   ...and so on.
*   **Talking Points:** "And here we have it. In under a minute, Orchestrate has done what would have taken Sarah hours. She has a ranked, qualified shortlist with AI-generated summaries. This is a massive time-saver and ensures every candidate is evaluated against the exact same criteria."

**Step 4: Deeper Dive & Human-in-the-Loop**
*   **Action:** Type a follow-up request.
    > **"Generate a detailed summary brief for the top 3 candidates and send it to me and the hiring manager, David Lee."**
*   **Talking Points:** "Sarah likes what she sees. Now she wants to prepare a brief for the hiring manager. She asks Orchestrate to do the prep work."
*   **Expected Outcome:** Orchestrate confirms the action. *“I have generated the summary brief and emailed it to you and David Lee. Would you like to proceed with scheduling interviews?”*
*   **Presenter:** "The assistant has just used a generative AI tool to create a professional document highlighting each candidate's strengths and qualifications relative to the role, and then used an email tool to distribute it. This elevates the service Sarah provides to her hiring managers."

**Step 5: Taking Action - Scheduling**
*   **Action:** Respond to the prompt.
    > **"Yes, find 30-minute slots next week for David to speak with the top 3 candidates."**
*   **Talking Points:** "This is the final step. The assistant is now using a `calendar_scheduler` tool that integrates with your corporate Microsoft 365. It checks David's availability, finds mutually available times, and can even send the invitations out to the candidates."
*   **Expected Outcome:** A confirmation message appears. *“Interview slots have been identified and placeholders have been added to David Lee's calendar. I am ready to send the invitations upon your confirmation.”*
*   **Demo Recap:** "So, let's recap. In about five minutes, we went from a new job requisition to a fully screened, ranked, and summarized shortlist, with interviews ready to be scheduled. We've automated hours of manual work, improved consistency, and accelerated the entire process."

### **V. How It Works: Under the Hood (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter uses a single, clear slide for this section)**

*   **The Building Blocks:** "What you just saw was powered by three core components of watsonx Orchestrate:"
    1.  **Agents:** "The 'Talent Acquisition Assistant' itself is an **Agent**. It's the brain that understands the goal, plans the steps, and decides which tools to use."
    2.  **Tools:** "These are the hands of the agent. Tools like `get_requisition_details` and `screen_resumes` are simply Python functions or API connections built using our **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. Your developers can easily create new tools to connect to any system at Xerox that has an API."
    3.  **Knowledge Bases:** "We can also connect the agent to a **Knowledge Base**—for example, your internal HR policies or interview guidelines. This allows the agent to answer questions from recruiters or candidates with information grounded in Xerox's official documentation."
*   **The Developer Experience:** "The ADK makes this incredibly accessible for your IT team. If they can write a Python function, they can build a custom tool for Orchestrate. This allows you to build assistants for any part of your business, from HR to Finance to IT Operations."

### **VI. Business Value & ROI for Xerox (2 minutes)**

**(Talking Points)**

*   **This is not just about efficiency; it's about enabling your business strategy.**
*   **Accelerate 'Project Reinvention':**
    *   **Reduce Time-to-Hire by 30-40%:** Fill critical digital and IT services roles faster, getting revenue-generating talent in the door sooner.
    *   **Increase Recruiter Capacity by 2x:** Allow each recruiter to manage more strategic requisitions by automating the top of the funnel. This means you can scale your hiring without scaling your HR headcount.
*   **Improve Quality & Consistency:**
    *   **Enhance Quality of Hire:** AI-driven screening ensures you find the best-fit candidates based on data, not gut feel, reducing the risk of bad hires.
    *   **Boost Hiring Manager Satisfaction:** Deliver high-quality, pre-vetted shortlists, saving your technical leaders valuable time and building their confidence in the TA process.
*   **Tangible ROI:** "By automating just the screening and scheduling portion of the workflow, we estimate you can save over **10 hours of work per requisition**. For a team hiring hundreds of roles a year, this translates into thousands of hours of strategic time given back to the business."

### **VII. Prepared Q&A (Anticipated Questions)**

*   **Q1: How does this handle the security and privacy of candidate PII?**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. watsonx Orchestrate is built on IBM's enterprise-grade cloud, with robust data protection. For sensitive data, the models and the entire workflow can be run within your own VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). Furthermore, watsonx.governance provides a layer of tracking and explainability for all AI-driven decisions.
*   **Q2: How is this different from our own Xerox AI Agent Builder?**
    *   **A:** They are complementary. Your Agent Builder is excellent for creating specialized AI models. Orchestrate is the platform that *puts those agents to work* within your enterprise. You could build a resume-screening agent with your tool, and then plug it into Orchestrate as a 'skill' that can then connect to Workday, Microsoft 365, and other systems to complete the end-to-end workflow. Orchestrate provides the connectivity, sequencing, and security layer.
*   **Q3: How much work is it to integrate this with our systems like Workday or SAP SuccessFactors?**
    *   **A:** Our Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for this. If your system has a REST API, a developer can build a custom tool to connect to it in a matter of hours or days, not weeks. We provide pre-built connectors for many common applications as well.
*   **Q4: What is the learning curve for our recruiters to use this?**
    *   **A:** As you saw, the interface is a simple, natural language chat. If they can use a messaging app, they can use Orchestrate. The goal is zero training for the end-user. The complexity is handled by the platform, not the person.
