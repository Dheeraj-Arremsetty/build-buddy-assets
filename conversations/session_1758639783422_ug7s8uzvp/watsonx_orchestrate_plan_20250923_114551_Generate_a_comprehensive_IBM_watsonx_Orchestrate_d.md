# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Financial Trade Settlement Automation

## 1. Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building a powerful watsonx Orchestrate demonstration tailored for a financial services client. The demo showcases a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to automate the end-to-end trade reconciliation and settlement process. This addresses the client's key challenges of slow, manual, and error-prone workflows by introducing an AI-powered solution that enhances efficiency, ensures compliance, and provides deep insights into settlement risks.

The architecture consists of a supervisor agent that orchestrates a team of specialized collaborator agents, each responsible for a distinct phase of the settlement lifecycle: data ingestion, validation and compliance, risk analysis, and final reporting. This modular design demonstrates how watsonx Orchestrate can break down complex business processes into manageable, automated tasks, integrating seamlessly with various enterprise systems (simulated via custom tools) to deliver a robust, auditable, and intelligent automation solution.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is properly configured.

*   **Python:** Python 3.10 or later installed.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK:** The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed. If not, run:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
*   **Orchestrate Environment:** You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. Initialize it using the `orchestrate env` command and ensure you are logged in.
*   **Project Directory:** Create a dedicated project directory to organize all files.

    ```bash
    mkdir fincorp_settlement_demo
    cd fincorp_settlement_demo
    mkdir agents
    mkdir tools
    ```
*   **Required Python Packages:** You will need the `requests` library for the tool examples. Create a `requirements.txt` file and install it.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create the `requirements.txt` File

In the root of your `fincorp_settlement_demo` directory, create a file named `requirements.txt`. This file will list all the necessary Python packages for your custom tools.

**File: `requirements.txt`**
```text
requests
```

Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Create the Custom Tools

We will create a set of Python-based tools that simulate interactions with various financial systems. These tools will generate realistic synthetic data to power the demo.

#### Tool 1: Data Ingestion Tools

These tools simulate fetching raw trade and counterparty data from source systems. They are crucial for the first step of the settlement process, providing the foundational data that all subsequent agents will act upon.

**File: `tools/data_ingestion_tools.py`**
```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from uuid import uuid4
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="fetch_trade_data", description="Fetches raw trade data for a specific batch ID from the primary trading system.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_trade_data(trade_batch_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Simulates fetching a batch of raw trade data from a core trading system based on a batch ID.

    Args:
        trade_batch_id (str): The unique identifier for the trade batch to be processed.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of trade records. Each record includes details like trade ID, ticker, quantity, price, and trade date.
    """
    try:
        trades = []
        tickers = ["IBM", "AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "AMZN"]
        for _ in range(random.randint(3, 7)):
            trade_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=random.randint(1, 3))
            trades.append({
                "trade_id": f"T{random.randint(10000, 99999)}",
                "trade_batch_id": trade_batch_id,
                "ticker": random.choice(tickers),
                "quantity": random.randint(100, 5000),
                "price": round(random.uniform(150.0, 500.0), 2),
                "trade_type": random.choice(["BUY", "SELL"]),
                "trade_date": trade_date.isoformat(),
                "counterparty_id": f"CP{random.randint(101, 105)}",
                "status": "PENDING_SETTLEMENT"
            })
        return json.dumps({"status": "success", "data": trades, "record_count": len(trades)})
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": str(e)})

@tool(name="get_counterparty_details", description="Retrieves detailed information for a list of counterparty IDs.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_counterparty_details(counterparty_ids: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    Simulates fetching detailed information for a list of counterparties from a master database.

    Args:
        counterparty_ids (list[str]): A list of unique counterparty identifiers.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing details for each counterparty, including name, region, and credit rating.
    """
    try:
        counterparties = {
            "CP101": {"name": "Global Investment Bank", "region": "NA", "credit_rating": "AA-"},
            "CP102": {"name": "European Securities", "region": "EMEA", "credit_rating": "A+"},
            "CP103": {"name": "APAC Trading Co.", "region": "APAC", "credit_rating": "A"},

            "CP105": {"name": "Union Finance Group", "region": "EMEA", "credit_rating": "A-"}
        }
        results = {cp_id: counterparties.get(cp_id, {"error": "Not Found"}) for cp_id in counterparty_ids}
        return json.dumps({"status": "success", "data": results})
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": str(e)})
```

#### Tool 2: Validation and Compliance Tools

These tools perform critical checks to ensure data integrity and regulatory adherence. They represent the gatekeeping function in the workflow, preventing non-compliant or erroneous trades from proceeding, thereby reducing operational and legal risk.

**File: `tools/validation_compliance_tools.py`**
```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="validate_trade_structure", description="Validates the structure and data types of enriched trade records.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def validate_trade_structure(enriched_trades: str) -> str:
    """
    Performs structural and data type validation on a list of enriched trade records.

    Args:
        enriched_trades (str): A JSON string representing a list of trade objects that include counterparty details.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string with the validation result, listing any invalid records and the reasons for failure.
    """
    try:
        trades = json.loads(enriched_trades)
        valid_records = []
        invalid_records = []
        required_fields = ["trade_id", "ticker", "quantity", "price", "counterparty_details"]

        for trade in trades:
            missing_fields = [field for field in required_fields if field not in trade]
            if missing_fields:
                invalid_records.append({"trade_id": trade.get("trade_id"), "error": f"Missing fields: {', '.join(missing_fields)}"})
            elif not isinstance(trade["quantity"], int) or trade["quantity"] <= 0:
                invalid_records.append({"trade_id": trade["trade_id"], "error": "Invalid quantity."})
            else:
                valid_records.append(trade)

        return json.dumps({
            "status": "success",
            "validation_summary": {
                "total_records": len(trades),
                "valid_count": len(valid_records),
                "invalid_count": len(invalid_records)
            },
            "valid_records": valid_records,
            "invalid_records": invalid_records
        })
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": "Invalid JSON format for enriched_trades."})
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": str(e)})

@tool(name="run_kyc_aml_check", description="Runs a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) check on counterparties.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def run_kyc_aml_check(counterparty_ids: list[str]) -> str:
