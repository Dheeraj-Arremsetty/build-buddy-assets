### **Section 1: The Opportunity & The Challenge (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter on screen, slide with S&P Global logo and IBM watsonx Orchestrate logo)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time. We've closely studied your market position and your forward-looking AI strategy, and frankly, it's impressive. S&P Global isn't just a data provider; you are the bedrock of the financial information ecosystem."
*   "Your acquisition of IHS Markit created what you rightly call an 'unparalleled data moat.' The challenge, as we see it, isn't the quality or breadth of your data, but how you unlock its next-generation value in an era of generative and agentic AI."
*   "Your research highlights a clear strategic goal: to move beyond static dashboards and allow clients to 'talk directly to their data.' It also mentions the vision for an 'Agent Builder'—a platform to create specialized AI agents. This is a brilliant strategy, but it presents a significant technical and business challenge."

**(Switch to a slide illustrating the challenge: S&P's data on one side, clients on the other, with a complex "How-To?" gap in the middle)**

*   "You're in an AI arms race. Competitors like Bloomberg are building their own foundational models, a costly and time-consuming endeavor. The market is shifting from 'Here's a data feed' to 'Here's an intelligent agent that works for you.'"
*   "The core challenge is this: How do you productize your data as AI agents **securely, at scale, and with governance?** How do you empower your clients—the financial analysts, the researchers—to build their own custom workflows using your trusted data, without them needing to be Python programmers or AI experts?"
*   "Answering this is the key to creating new, high-margin revenue streams and making your data platform stickier than ever before."

### **Section 2: The Solution: watsonx Orchestrate as Your Agent Factory (2 minutes)**

**(Switch to a slide with the watsonx Orchestrate logo at the center, connecting "S&P Data/Tools" to "Client-Built Custom Agents")**

**Talking Points:**

*   "This is precisely where IBM watsonx Orchestrate comes in. We're not here to propose an alternative to your data or your strategy. We're here to provide the **engine** for it. Think of Orchestrate as the foundational platform for your 'Agent Builder' vision—an **Agent Factory**."
*   "watsonx Orchestrate allows you to do two critical things, which we'll demonstrate today:"
    1.  **Create & Govern:** Your teams can create a library of certified, trusted **Tools** that connect securely to your data sources, like Snowflake. You maintain complete control over these data access points.
    2.  **Compose & Empower:** Your clients can then use these certified tools as building blocks to easily compose their own powerful, custom **Agents** to perform complex, multi-step analysis—all through simple instructions.
*   "This is achieved through a powerful **Supervisor/Collaborator** model. S&P provides the trusted 'Collaborator' agents that know how to access data, and your clients build the 'Supervisor' agents that orchestrate them. It’s a model built for security, scalability, and monetization."

### **Section 3: Live Demo: From Certified Tool to Client Insight (8 minutes)**

**Presenter:** "Let's make this real. I'm going to walk you through the exact use case you outlined: building an 'Emerging Market Opportunity Agent.' I'll play two roles: first, an S&P Global developer, and second, a financial analyst at one of your client firms."

#### **Part 1: The S&P Global Developer Persona - Creating the Governed Tools (3 mins)**

**(Presenter shares their screen showing a code editor with `sp_tools.py` and a terminal)**

*   "Okay, I'm now an S&P developer. My goal is to expose our proprietary market and ESG data from our Snowflake database in a secure, controlled way. I'm not giving clients direct database access; I'm building certified tools."
*   "Here in my code editor, I have two simple Python functions. The first is `get_market_data`... and the second is `get_company_esg_score`. These functions could contain complex logic to connect to Snowflake, but for today, they're reading from mock data files."
*   "Notice this decorator: `@tool`. This is the watsonx Orchestrate ADK (Agent Development Kit) at work. It turns this Python function into a reusable component for our agents. Most importantly, see this parameter: `permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN`. This is critical. It means only authorized S&P personnel can register or modify this tool. This is your governance layer, ensuring data integrity."
*   "Now, I'll register these tools with Orchestrate using a single command."
    *   **(Run `orchestrate tools import -f sp_tools.py`)**
*   "Next, I'll package these tools into a secure agent that acts as our official data gateway. I'll call it the `SP_Data_Steward_Agent`. I define it in this simple YAML file."
    *   **(Show `sp_data_steward_agent.yaml`, highlighting the `description` and the `tools` section)**
*   "The description is key—it tells other agents what this agent can do. Now, I'll import it."
    *   **(Run `orchestrate agents import -f sp_data_steward_agent.yaml`)**
*   "And that's it. As the S&P developer, my job is done. I have successfully productized two of our core data assets as secure, governed, reusable AI components."

#### **Part 2: The Financial Analyst Persona - Building a Custom Agent (2 mins)**

*   "Now, let's switch hats. I'm a financial analyst at a hedge fund. I'm great at market analysis but I'm not a coder. I want to build a custom agent to find opportunities in Brazil."
*   "Using the S&P 'Agent Builder' portal, powered by Orchestrate, I can define my own agent in another simple YAML file."
    *   **(Show `emerging_market_agent.yaml`)**
*   "Look closely. This agent has **no tools of its own**. Its power comes from this one line here: `collaborators: [SP_Data_Steward_Agent]`. I am telling my agent that it can use the certified, trusted agent provided by S&P Global."
*   "My instructions tell the agent *how* to think: First get market data, then for each company, get the ESG score, then filter, sort, and present the results. I'm defining a complex workflow in plain English."
*   "I'll import my new agent."
    *   **(Run `orchestrate agents import -f emerging_market_agent.yaml`)**
*   "In just a few minutes, with no complex coding, I've built a personalized, sophisticated analysis agent on top of S&P's trusted data foundation."

#### **Part 3: The Payoff - Answering the Million-Dollar Question (3 mins)**

*   "Now for the moment of truth. Let's start a chat with the agent I just built."
    *   **(Run `orchestrate chat start --agent Emerging_Market_Opportunity_Agent`)**
*   "I'll ask it the exact business question we defined:"
    *   **(Type the prompt): `Find the top 3 companies in the Brazilian technology sector by market cap that have an S&P ESG score above 75.`**
*   "Watch what happens. This is not a simple database query. The agent is reasoning. You can see its thought process here in the trace."
    *   **(Point to the reasoning steps on the screen as they appear)**
    *   "It understands it needs market data, so it calls the `SP_Data_Steward_Agent` to use the `get_market_data` tool."
    *   "Then, it iterates through the results, calling the `get_company_esg_score` tool for each company."
    *   "Finally, it performs the filtering and sorting *itself* based on my instructions, synthesizing the data from multiple tool calls into a single, actionable answer."
*   "And here is our final result."
    *   **(Highlight the expected output):**
        ```
        Here are the top 3 companies in the Brazilian technology sector with an S&P ESG score above 75, ranked by market cap:

        1.  Brasilia Digital (BDIG) - Market Cap: $25,000,000,000, ESG Score: 91
        2.  Digital Horizon (DHOR) - Market Cap: $22,000,000,000, ESG Score: 79
        3.  QuantumLeap Tech (QLEAP) - Market Cap: $15,000,000,000, ESG Score: 82
        ```
*   "We went from a complex business question to a precise, data-driven insight in seconds, using a custom-built agent that leverages S&P's governed, certified data. This is the 'Agent Builder' vision, brought to life."

### **Section 4: Business Value & The Path Forward (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter stops screen share, returns to a summary slide)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "So, what did we just see? We saw a clear blueprint for how S&P Global can evolve its business model."
*   **New Revenue Streams:** You're no longer just selling data access. You're selling **certified AI capabilities**. You can monetize access to the Data Steward agent itself, or offer premium, high-capability tools on a subscription basis.
*   **Increased Data Stickiness:** When clients build their critical workflows directly on your agentic platform, your data becomes truly indispensable. The cost and complexity of switching to a competitor become prohibitively high.
*   **Competitive Differentiation:** While competitors are building monolithic LLMs, you can leapfrog them by creating an open, composable **ecosystem**. You provide the trusted foundation, and you empower your clients and partners to innovate on top of it. This is a far more scalable and defensible strategy.
*   **Accelerated Time-to-Value:** Your teams can roll out new AI-powered products in days or weeks, not months or years. A new tool is just a new Python function. A new solution is just a new set of instructions for a supervisor agent.

---

### **Section 5: Q&A Preparation (Ready for discussion)**

**1. How does this ensure our data is secure? What does the LLM see?**
*   **Answer:** "This is a critical point. The LLM in the `SP_Data_Steward_Agent` only sees the metadata of the tools (the descriptions) to know *how* to call them. The actual execution of the tool—the Python code that connects to your Snowflake database—runs in **your secure environment**. The client's supervisor agent only passes the necessary inputs (like 'Brazil', 'Technology') and receives the data results. Your data credentials and proprietary logic never leave your control."

**2. How does this integrate with our existing data platforms like Snowflake?**
*   **Answer:** "Seamlessly. The Python tool function is the integration point. Inside the `get_market_data` function, you would simply use the standard Snowflake Python Connector to query your database. Orchestrate is backend-agnostic; it orchestrates the *logic* that you write, giving you the flexibility to connect to any API or database you need."

**3. Why shouldn't we just build this orchestration framework ourselves?**
*   **Answer:** "You certainly could, but it would mean diverting resources to build and maintain a complex reasoning engine, a multi-agent communication framework, LLM integrations, and developer tooling. watsonx Orchestrate provides all of that out-of-the-box, allowing you to focus on your core competency: creating high-value tools and analytics based on your unparalleled data. We provide the factory; you produce the valuable goods."

**4. How does this scale to thousands of clients and millions of queries?**
*   **Answer:** "The platform is built on a robust, enterprise-grade microservices architecture designed for scale. The agentic framework itself is efficient. The heavy lifting (data querying) is done by your existing systems, which are already built to scale. Orchestrate handles the 'last mile' of reasoning and composition, which is a much lighter workload."

### **Section 6: Next Steps & Call to Action (1 minute)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "What we've shown you today is a powerful, practical, and rapid way to realize your 'Agent Builder' strategy and create a significant competitive advantage."
*   "We believe the best way to move forward is to get hands-on. We propose a two-day, collaborative workshop where we take one of your real-world data sources and build a live Proof-of-Concept agent with your team."
*   "This will allow you to validate the technology, experience the development speed firsthand, and begin mapping out the architecture for your own S&P Global Agent Factory."
*   "Thank you for your time. I'll open it up for any final questions."
