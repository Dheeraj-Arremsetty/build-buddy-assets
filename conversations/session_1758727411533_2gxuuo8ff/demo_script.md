## Demo Script: Transforming Delta Operations with AeroAssist, Powered by IBM watsonx Orchestrate

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Audience:** Delta Airlines - Operations, IT, and Innovation Stakeholders
**Time Allotment:** 20 Minutes

### Section 1: Introduction & The Delta Challenge (3 Minutes)

**(Slide 1: Title Slide - "Transforming Delta Operations with AeroAssist, Powered by IBM watsonx Orchestrate" with Delta and IBM logos)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Good morning, and thank you for your time. We've reviewed the deep search analysis on Delta's market position, and it's clear that your brand is built on three pillars: operational reliability, superior customer service, and a premium travel experience."
*   "We understand that maintaining this leadership position in a highly competitive industry requires constant innovation. Every minute an aircraft is on the ground, every procedural delay, and every safety-compliance question directly impacts your bottom line and your brand promise."
*   "The challenge is that the critical knowledge needed to maintain this excellence—technical manuals, operating procedures, safety regulations—is often locked away in dense, static documents. Your highly skilled maintenance crews and flight crews spend valuable time searching for information instead of acting on it."

**(Slide 2: The High Cost of Inefficiency)**

*   **Image:** A split screen showing a maintenance technician on a tablet on the tarmac and a pilot in the cockpit looking at a manual.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   **Aircraft on Ground (AOG):** Costs can exceed $150,000 per hour.
    *   **On-Time Performance:** A 1% improvement can significantly boost revenue and customer loyalty.
    *   **Safety & Compliance:** Non-negotiable, but manual verification is time-consuming and prone to error.

**Key Message:** The core operational challenge isn't a lack of information, but a lack of *instant, contextual access* to the right information and the ability to act on it immediately.

### Section 3: Live Demo: AeroAssist in Action (8 Minutes)

"Now, let's see AeroAssist in action. I'll be taking on the roles of a maintenance technician and a pilot interacting with the system."

**(Presenter switches to live demo screen - a terminal running `orchestrate chat start --agent AeroAssist_Supervisor`)**

#### **Scenario 1: Maintenance Troubleshooting & Action (AOG Prevention)**

"Imagine I'm a technician on the tarmac. An A321 has just reported a hydraulic system alert. Time is critical."

*   **Presenter types:**
    `What are the possible causes for hydraulic system pressure low alert on an A321, fault code 29-11-00?`

*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The supervisor agent instantly delegates to the `Maintenance_Technician_Agent`.
    *   The agent responds with a concise, technical answer.
    *   **Crucially, the response includes citations:** `Source: A321_AMM.pdf, Section 29, Page 15-2.`

*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "Notice two things here. First, the supervisor agent knew exactly who to ask—it routed my technical query to the maintenance expert. The user doesn't need to know the org chart."
    *   "Second, and most importantly, this isn't a generic web search. This answer is grounded *exclusively* in your trusted Airbus Maintenance Manual. The citation provides the auditability and trust your technicians require. This is Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, in action."

"Okay, based on the manual, I've diagnosed a probable leak. Now I need to log a work order. I don't need to switch apps or fill out a form."

*   **Presenter types:**
    `Log a priority 1 issue for aircraft N301DN regarding a suspected leak in the green hydraulic line.`

*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The agent understands the intent to "log an issue."
    *   It invokes the `log_maintenance_issue` tool.
    *   The agent responds: `Successfully created maintenance ticket MX-84321 for aircraft N301DN.`

*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "AeroAssist just went from providing knowledge to taking action. It used a custom tool we built to connect directly to your maintenance system, automating the ticket creation process. This reduces administrative overhead, eliminates data entry errors, and gets the repair process started seconds after diagnosis."

#### **Scenario 2: Pre-Flight Procedure Verification (Safety & Efficiency)**

"Now let's switch roles. I'm a pilot in the cockpit preparing for a flight in cold weather conditions. I need to verify a critical procedure."

*   **Presenter types:**
    `What are the exact steps for the de-icing communications check?`

*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The supervisor agent routes the request to the `Flight_Crew_Agent`.
    *   The agent invokes the `get_preflight_procedure` tool.
    *   The agent returns a perfectly formatted, step-by-step checklist.
    *   The response includes a source: `Source: FCOM Vol 2, Section 5.3, Page 12.`

*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "Instead of searching a 500-page PDF, the pilot gets an unambiguous, actionable checklist in seconds. This is not just about speed; it's about ensuring procedural discipline and enhancing safety, especially in high-pressure situations."

#### **Scenario 3: Intelligent Routing (Seamless User Experience)**

"Finally, let's ask a question that could apply to either role to test the supervisor's intelligence."

*   **Presenter types:**
    `What are the crew rest requirements according to FAA regulations?`

*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The supervisor agent analyzes the request. It sees the keywords "crew rest" and "regulations," which strongly align with the `Flight_Crew_Agent`'s description.
    *   It correctly routes the query to the `Flight_Crew_Agent`.
    *   The agent queries its knowledge base, using the `Safety_Compliance_Regs.txt` document, and provides a sourced answer.

*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "This demonstrates the power of the supervisor agent pattern. Your employees have one place to go—AeroAssist. The system intelligently handles the routing, ensuring the user gets the best possible answer from the right specialist without any extra effort."

### Section 4: Under the Hood: The watsonx Orchestrate Advantage (3 Minutes)

**(Slide 4: The AeroAssist Architecture: Simple, Powerful, Extensible)**

*   **Diagram:** A simple flow chart: User -> AeroAssist Supervisor -> (routes to) Maintenance Agent OR Flight Crew Agent. Show the agents connecting to Knowledge Bases (PDFs) and Tools (APIs).

**Talking Points:**

*   "So, how did we build this so quickly? This is the power of the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit, or ADK."
*   **Agent-First Architecture:** "We built a team of AI agents. The **Supervisor** acts as a manager, while the **Collaborators** are specialists. We defined their expertise in simple YAML files, telling them what they know and what they can do. This is a highly scalable and manageable approach."
*   **Grounding in Your Truth (RAG):** "We didn't train a new model from scratch. We simply pointed the agents to your existing documents—the A321 manuals and regulations. The agents use these as their knowledge base, ensuring answers are accurate, relevant, and auditable."
*   **From Answers to Actions (Tools):** "The real magic happens when agents can *do* things. We used simple Python functions to create tools that connect to other systems. That `log_maintenance_issue` tool could easily be adapted to connect to your live ServiceNow or SAP instance via an API."

**Technical Highlight:** The ADK provides a flexible, code-first framework for your developers to rapidly build, test, and deploy sophisticated AI agents that are deeply integrated with your unique operational environment. You maintain full control and ownership.

#### **Q&A Preparation:**

*   **Q: How secure is our proprietary data (manuals, etc.)?**
    *   **A:** Your data security is paramount. With watsonx Orchestrate, your documents are processed within your secure IBM Cloud environment. The knowledge base is isolated to your instance, and the models do not train on your data. You maintain full data sovereignty.
*   **Q: How does this handle complex or ambiguous questions? What about hallucinations?**
    *   **A:** The RAG pattern is specifically designed to mitigate hallucinations. Because the agent is instructed to answer *only* from the provided documents, it is far less likely to invent information. For ambiguous questions, the agent can be instructed to ask for clarification, just as a human would.
*   **Q: How difficult is it to integrate this with our existing systems like ServiceNow or SAP?**
    *   **A:** It's very straightforward. The ADK allows developers to wrap any API call in a simple Python function and register it as a tool. If you have an API for a system, we can connect AeroAssist to it.
*   **Q: What skills do our developers need to build and maintain this?**
    *   **A:** The primary skills are Python and a basic understanding of APIs and YAML. The ADK is designed to be accessible to a broad range of developers, not just AI specialists.

#### **Next Steps & Call to Action**
