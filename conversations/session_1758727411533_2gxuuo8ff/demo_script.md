### **Part 2: The Problem - The High Cost of "Looking For Stuff" (3 Minutes)**

**(Slide 2: Image of a technician on a tablet in front of an aircraft engine)**

**Talking Points:**
*   "Let's ground this in a real-world scenario. Imagine an AOG—Aircraft on Ground—situation at ATL. A maintenance technician needs to troubleshoot a landing gear issue on an A321. The clock is ticking, and every minute costs thousands of dollars in potential delays."
*   "What happens today? That technician might have to:
    *   Stop their work to find the right maintenance manual—a massive, thousand-page PDF.
    *   Use `Ctrl+F` to search for a specific torque value, hoping the OCR is correct.
    *   Leave the aircraft to call a parts depot or log into a separate inventory system to see if a replacement nut is in stock.
    *   After the job is done, they have to remember to log the task in the maintenance system, often at the end of a long shift."
*   "This 'information friction' is a major source of inefficiency and risk. It slows down repairs, introduces the potential for human error, and makes compliance tracking a manual, after-the-fact process. The expertise is in your people's heads and in your manuals; the challenge is connecting them instantly at the point of action."

**Key Message:** The core business challenge isn't a lack of information or skilled personnel; it's the delay and complexity in accessing and acting on trusted information when and where it's needed most.

### **Part 3: The Solution - The Aviation Operations Co-Pilot (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 3: Diagram showing the Supervisor/Collaborator Agent Architecture)**

**Talking Points:**
*   "Our solution is an AI Co-Pilot built with **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**. Think of Orchestrate as a factory for building enterprise-grade AI agents that can **Reason**, **Search**, and **Act**."
*   "The agent we've built for this demo has three core capabilities that directly address the challenges we just discussed:"
    1.  **Precision Knowledge Retrieval (RAG):** It provides instant, sourced answers by searching Delta's own trusted documents—maintenance manuals, operating handbooks, and regulatory filings. No more manual searching.
    2.  **Automated Tool Use:** It connects conversation directly to your business systems. It can check parts inventory, log maintenance tasks, or create work orders by calling APIs, just like a human would use an application.
    3.  **Intelligent Routing:** We've built a multi-agent system. A single 'Supervisor' agent understands the user's intent and routes the request to the correct specialist—either the `Maintenance Tech Agent` or the `Flight Crew Agent`. This model is incredibly scalable and ensures the right expert is always on the job.

**Value Proposition:** We are transforming static documentation and siloed applications into a dynamic, conversational resource that empowers your team to work faster, smarter, and safer.

### **Part 4: Live Demonstration (8 Minutes)**

**(Presenter shares their screen showing a command line or simple web chat interface)**

"Let's see this in action. I'm going to be playing the role of different Delta employees interacting with our **AviationOps Supervisor** agent."

#### **Scenario 1: Precision Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)**
*   **Persona:** Maintenance Technician on the tarmac.
*   **Talking Points:** "My technician needs a critical piece of technical data, fast. I'm not asking a generic question; I need a specific, verifiable fact from the official manual."
*   **Demo Action:**
    *   **User Prompt:** `What is the torque spec for the main gear axle nut on the A321X?`
*   **Behind the Scenes:** "The Supervisor agent instantly recognizes this is a maintenance query and routes it to the `Maintenance_Tech_Agent`. This agent doesn't guess; it performs a vector search across the A321X Maintenance Manual we've indexed."
*   **Expected Outcome (Agent Response):**
    > "According to the IBM-A321X Aircraft Maintenance Manual (Document ID: AMM-A321X-LG-Rev4), the torque specification for the main gear axle nut (Part Number: HG-455B) is **1500 ft-lbs (2033.7 Nm)**."
*   **Key Message:** "Notice two things: the answer is immediate and precise. Most importantly, it's *sourced*. This is the foundation of trust and auditability that is non-negotiable in aviation."

#### **Scenario 2: Multi-Turn Conversation with Tool Use**
*   **Persona:** Same Maintenance Technician.
*   **Talking Points:** "Okay, I have the spec, and I see the part needs replacing. Now, instead of making a phone call, I'll just ask the agent."
*   **Demo Action (Step 1):**
    *   **User Prompt:** `Great. Can you check inventory for part number HG-455B?`
*   **Behind the Scenes:** "The agent understands this isn't a knowledge question; it's an action. It's now executing the `check_part_inventory` tool, which is a Python function making a live API call to our mock inventory system."
*   **Expected Outcome (Agent Response):**
    > "I've checked the inventory system. There are **12 units** of part HG-455B (Main gear axle nut) available at location **ATL-Hangar 3**."
*   **Talking Points:** "The part is available. I complete the replacement. Now for the final, crucial step: compliance and record-keeping."
*   **Demo Action (Step 2):**
    *   **User Prompt:** `Perfect. Please log the replacement of the main gear axle nut on aircraft N505DN as complete.`
*   **Behind the Scenes:** "The agent is now executing a different tool: `log_maintenance_task`. This function is creating a structured log entry that would, in a real environment, be written directly into your maintenance record system."
*   **Expected Outcome (Agent Response):**
    > "Task logged successfully. A maintenance record for 'replacement of the main gear axle nut' on aircraft N505DN has been created with Log ID: LOG-1727281934."
*   **Key Message:** "We just went from a technical question to a parts check to a compliance action in a single, seamless conversation. This closes the loop on the entire task, reducing administrative burden and ensuring 100% accurate, real-time logging."

#### **Scenario 3: Supervisor Agent Routing**
*   **Persona:** A Pilot preparing for a flight.
*   **Talking Points:** "Now, let's switch personas. I'm a pilot with a procedural question. Watch how the same entry point—the Supervisor—handles a completely different domain of expertise."
*   **Demo Action:**
    *   **User Prompt:** `What are the standard go-around procedures for a CAT II approach?`
*   **Behind the Scenes:** "The `AviationOps_Supervisor` reads this prompt and, based on the descriptions we gave our agents, it knows this isn't for maintenance. It intelligently routes the request to the `Flight_Crew_Agent`, which has access to the Crew Operating Handbook."
*   **Expected Outcome (Agent Response):**
    > "From the Crew Operating Handbook, here is the Go-Around Procedure for a CAT II Approach:
    > 1.  **"Go-Around, Flaps" Callout:** Pilot Flying (PF) announces the go-around.
    > 2.  **TOGA Thrust:** Press the Take-off/Go-around (TOGA) switches.
    > 3.  **Pitch:** Rotate smoothly to the go-around pitch attitude...
    > *[...continues with the full checklist]*"
*   **Key Message:** "This demonstrates the power of the multi-agent architecture. You don't need to build one monolithic, impossibly complex agent. You build a team of specialized AI experts and a supervisor to manage them. This is more scalable, more accurate, and easier to maintain."

### **Part 5: Business Value & Technical Highlights (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 4: Four quadrants - Efficiency, Safety, Compliance, Empowerment)**

**Talking Points:**
*   "So, what does this all mean for Delta? Let's translate these features into business value."
    *   **Efficiency & Cost Savings:** We're reducing Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) by cutting down information search time. Saving just 15 minutes per technician per day across your workforce adds up to millions in productivity gains and reduced flight delays.
    *   **Safety & Reliability:** By providing instant access to the single source of truth—your manuals—we reduce the risk of human error. The agent will always provide the correct torque spec or procedure.
    *   **Compliance & Auditability:** Automating task logging ensures a perfect, real-time audit trail. This simplifies compliance with FAA regulations and strengthens your safety management system.
    *   **Employee Empowerment & Onboarding:** This tool acts as a mentor for new technicians, accelerating their training and giving them the confidence to perform complex tasks. It captures the expertise of your most senior staff and makes it available to everyone.

**(Slide 5: Technical Highlights)**
*   "And from a technical standpoint, this is built for the enterprise.
    *   **Built with the ADK:** The Agent Development Kit allows your teams to rapidly build, test, and deploy these agents using simple Python and YAML.
    *   **Grounded in Your Data:** Using RAG with the built-in vector database ensures the agent is grounded in *your* trusted documents, dramatically reducing the risk of hallucination.
    *   **Secure & Governed:** This is built on watsonx, IBM's enterprise AI platform. Your data is your data—it is not used to train our base models. You maintain full control and governance."

### **Part 6: Q&A and Next Steps (2 Minutes)**

**Q&A Preparation:**

*   **Q: How do you handle complex, multi-page PDF documents with tables and diagrams?**
    *   **A:** Our ingestion process uses advanced document parsing to handle complex structures, including tables. While the current text-based models don't interpret diagrams, we can include the text descriptions and captions associated with them, and future multi-modal models will expand this capability.
*   **Q: How does this integrate with our real systems like SAP for maintenance or our crew scheduling software?**
    *   **A:** The "Tools" are the key. They are incredibly flexible. We can write Python tools that connect to any system with an API, like SAP. We can also import existing OpenAPI specifications. Integration is a core strength of the platform.
*   **Q: How do we ensure the agent doesn't give a wrong or "hallucinated" answer?**
    *   **A:** We use a multi-layered approach. First, RAG grounds the agent in your specific factual documents. Second, the `instructions` in the agent's definition file provide strict guardrails on its behavior. Third, for actions, the tools are deterministic code—they either succeed or fail, they don't hallucinate. This combination creates a highly reliable and trusted system.

**(Slide 6: Next Steps)**

**Call to Action:**
*   "What we've shown you is a powerful proof of concept. The next step is to make it real for Delta."
*   "We propose a **2-Day Co-Creation Workshop** with your maintenance and IT stakeholders.
    *   **Day 1:** We'll identify the highest-value initial use case—perhaps for a specific fleet like the A220 or a specific task like line maintenance checks.
    *   **Day 2:** We'll map out the specific data sources (manuals, systems) and define the success criteria for a pilot project."
*   "Our goal is to move from this demo to a functional pilot in your hands within a matter of weeks, not months. Thank you for your time."
