### **Part 1: Introduction & Setting the Stage (2 minutes)**

**[SAY]**

"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with the IBM watsonx Orchestrate team.

I've had a chance to review the excellent Deep Search report your team commissioned. It correctly identifies IBM's strategic focus on becoming the leader in enterprise-grade AI and hybrid cloud. The report highlights our watsonx platform as the core of this strategy, emphasizing governance, trust, and data privacy—qualities that are non-negotiable for businesses like yours.

Today, we're going to move from the 'what' and 'why' of that report to the 'how'. How does IBM's AI strategy translate into tangible business value for you? We'll do that by showing you **IBM watsonx Orchestrate** in action, tackling a universal, yet notoriously complex business process: new hire onboarding."

### **Part 2: The Business Challenge: The Onboarding Maze (2 minutes)**

**[SAY]**

"Let's talk about onboarding. For most organizations, it's a maze of manual tasks, endless email chains, and siloed processes. A hiring manager has to chase down IT for a laptop and accounts, follow up with HR for payroll and benefits, and coordinate with a training department for mandatory courses.

*(Click to next slide showing a chaotic workflow diagram)*

This disjointed process leads to very real business problems:
*   **Lost Productivity:** Both for the hiring manager and the new employee, who might wait days or even weeks for the tools they need to be productive.
*   **Inconsistent Experience:** A great candidate experience can turn sour with a clunky, disorganized first week.
*   **Compliance & Security Risks:** When tasks are manual, things get missed. Was security training completed? Was the right access granted? This creates an audit nightmare.

The core challenge isn't a lack of systems; you have great systems for HR, IT, and learning. The challenge is the **human middleware** required to coordinate work *across* them.

So, what if you could eliminate that friction? What if a hiring manager could initiate and manage the entire end-to-end onboarding process with a single, simple request in natural language?"

### **Part 3: The Solution: Your AI-Powered Digital Team (2 minutes)**

**[SAY]**

"That's exactly what IBM watsonx Orchestrate is designed to do. Think of it as providing every employee with a team of AI-powered digital assistants, or 'agents,' that understand their goals and know how to get work done across your enterprise applications.

For our onboarding scenario, we've built a specialized digital team.

*(Click to next slide showing a simple hierarchy diagram)*

1.  **The Onboarding Supervisor:** This is the manager's single point of contact. It understands the overall goal of 'onboarding a new hire.' It doesn't perform tasks itself; its job is to delegate.
2.  **The Collaborators:** Just like a real team, the Supervisor has specialists it trusts:
    *   An **IT Provisioning Agent** that knows how to create accounts and order hardware.
    *   An **HR Onboarding Agent** that handles payroll and benefits.
    *   A **Training Enrollment Agent** that manages the learning plan.

These agents are equipped with **tools** that connect to your systems and a **knowledge base** of your company's trusted documents. Today, you'll see this digital team work in concert to deliver a seamless, automated, and intelligent onboarding experience."

### **Part 4: Live Demonstration: Onboarding Priya Sharma (9 minutes)**

**[SAY]**

"Alright, let's put this into practice. I'm going to put on my 'hiring manager' hat. We've just hired a new Software Engineer, Priya Sharma, and I need to get her onboarding process started. I'll open up my watsonx Orchestrate chat interface.

#### **Scenario 1: The Full Onboarding Request (4 mins)**

**[DEMO ACTION]**
Type the following prompt into the chat interface:
`"Start onboarding for our new Software Engineer, Priya Sharma, starting on August 1st. Her employee ID is 789456."`

**[SAY]**
"That's it. No forms, no tickets, no emails. I've stated my intent in plain English.

Now, watch what happens. The **Onboarding Supervisor Agent** has received this request. It understands the keywords 'onboarding,' 'Software Engineer,' and the specific details for Priya. It's now breaking down this complex goal into sub-tasks and delegating them to its specialist collaborators.

*(As the agent responds with its plan and executes, narrate the results as they appear on screen.)*

"First, it's engaging the **IT Provisioning Agent**. Look at this—it's already created a user account and email for Priya. It also used her role, 'Software Engineer,' to automatically order the correct high-performance hardware kit and assign the necessary developer software licenses like JetBrains and Docker. We get back confirmation numbers and even a tracking number for the laptop.

Simultaneously, it's tasked the **HR Onboarding Agent**. The agent has used its `setup_payroll` tool to register Priya in the system and has already sent the benefits enrollment package to her new email address.

And finally, it's activated the **Training Enrollment Agent**. This agent first looked up the required training plan for a Software Engineer and is now enrolling Priya in each mandatory course: Secure Software Development, Code of Conduct, and Advanced Git.

In less than a minute, a process that would have taken a dozen emails and several hours of manual work is complete. The Supervisor gives me a full summary, and I have a complete, auditable record of every action taken."

#### **Scenario 2: The Ad-Hoc Status Check (2 mins)**

**[SAY]**
"The real world is dynamic. What if I need an update a few days later? I don't need to remember which system to check or who to ask. I just talk to my supervisor.

**[DEMO ACTION]**
Type the following prompt:
`"What is the status of Priya Sharma's hardware order?"`

**[SAY]**
"Notice how the Supervisor Agent intelligently routes this. It recognizes 'hardware order' as an IT-related query and passes it directly to the **IT Provisioning Agent**. The IT agent retrieves the information and provides a direct, concise answer with the tracking number and estimated delivery date. This demonstrates that Orchestrate isn't just a rigid workflow engine; it's a conversational and intelligent interface to your business operations."

#### **Scenario 3: The Knowledge-Based Inquiry (3 mins)**

**[SAY]**
"This final scenario is incredibly important. What about questions that aren't transactional? What about company policies that live in documents? A new hire, or even me as the manager, might have questions.

Let's ask about our benefits.

**[DEMO ACTION]**
Type the following prompt:
`"What are the details of the PPO health plan?"`

**[SAY]**
"This is where the magic of watsonx comes in. The Supervisor routes this to the **HR Onboarding Agent**. But this time, the agent isn't using a tool to execute a transaction. It's using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, or RAG.

It securely accesses its attached knowledge base—which we've loaded with your trusted HR documents like the Benefits Guide PDF—finds the relevant information, and synthesizes a clear, accurate answer based *only* on that trusted data.

This is enterprise-grade AI. We're not sending your sensitive policy questions to a public model. We're grounding the AI in *your* data, ensuring the answers are accurate, governed, and secure. This builds trust and turns your static documents into an interactive knowledge source."

### **Part 5: Under the Hood: The Power of the Platform (2 minutes)**

**[SAY]**

"What you just saw was a seamless user experience, but it's powered by a robust and developer-friendly platform. Let me quickly show you how we built this.

*(Briefly show a slide with the following snippets)*

*   **Agent Definition (YAML):** This is the `Onboarding_Supervisor_Agent`. It's a simple text file where we define its name, the AI model it uses, its collaborators, and its instructions in plain English. This is the 'brain' that controls its delegation logic.
*   **Custom Tools (Python):** This is our `it_tools.py` file. Any Python function can be turned into a tool that an agent can use with a simple `@tool` decorator. This means your developers can easily connect Orchestrate to any API or internal system.
*   **Knowledge Base:** We simply pointed the HR agent to a folder containing our policy PDFs. The platform handles the complex work of indexing and retrieval.

The key takeaway is that watsonx Orchestrate is not a black box. It's an open, extensible platform built on our Agent Development Kit (ADK) that empowers your teams to build custom AI agents for any process that is critical to your business."

### **Part 6: Business Value & Next Steps (2 minutes)**

**[SAY]**

"So, let's bring this back to the business value we discussed at the beginning. With watsonx Orchestrate, we've transformed the onboarding maze into a streamlined, intelligent workflow.

The ROI is clear and compelling:
*   **Radical Efficiency:** We've automated hours of manual coordination into a single, one-minute request.
*   **Accelerated Time-to-Productivity:** Priya has everything she needs on Day 1, not Day 5.
*   **Superior Employee Experience:** We've delivered a modern, consistent, and world-class welcome.
*   **Ironclad Governance:** The entire process is automated, repeatable, and auditable, dramatically reducing compliance risk.

This is just one example. Imagine applying this same pattern to sales order processing, customer service escalations, or financial reporting.

Our recommended next step is a collaborative workshop. We'd love to work with you to identify the most impactful use case within your organization and scope a Proof of Concept to demonstrate the power of watsonx Orchestrate on your specific challenges."

### **Part 7: Q&A Preparation (Flexible)**

**Q1: How does this connect to our existing systems like Workday or ServiceNow?**
**A:** "Great question. The Python tools we showed are the integration points. Our developers would use those Python functions to call the APIs of your existing systems, like Workday for HR data or ServiceNow to create an IT ticket. Orchestrate acts as the intelligent orchestration layer on top of the systems you already own and trust."

**Q2: How secure is this? You mentioned our HR documents.**
**A:** "Security is paramount, and it's a core differentiator for watsonx. The knowledge base is contained within your secure watsonx environment. When the agent performs a retrieval, the query and the documents never leave that trusted boundary. We are not training public models on your data. You maintain full control and ownership."

**Q3: How much effort is it to build an agent like this?**
**A:** "The 'heavy lifting' is in creating the tools that connect to your systems. If you already have APIs, our Agent Development Kit makes it very fast—a developer can wrap an existing API call in a Python tool in minutes. Defining the agents themselves in YAML is very straightforward, as you saw. For a well-defined process like this, a Proof of Concept can be built in a matter of weeks, not months."

**Q4: How does this compare to basic RPA or workflow tools?**
**A:** "RPA is great for automating repetitive, screen-level tasks. Standard workflow is good for rigid, pre-defined processes. Orchestrate is a significant leap forward. It understands natural language and user *intent*. It can dynamically reason, delegate, and combine tools to achieve a goal, even for tasks it hasn't seen in that exact sequence before. The supervisor/collaborator model allows it to handle much more complex, multi-domain processes, and the integrated RAG capability brings unstructured knowledge into the automation."
