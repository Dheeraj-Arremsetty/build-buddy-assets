# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Financial Compliance & Reporting Automation for FinSecure Analytics

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building a powerful IBM watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for **FinSecure Analytics**. The client's primary challenge is the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of generating quarterly financial compliance and risk assessment reports. Data is siloed across trading, client management, and market data systems, leading to inefficiencies and potential regulatory risks.

This demo will construct a multi-agent system that automates the entire reporting workflow. A top-level **Supervisor Agent** will orchestrate a team of specialized **Collaborator Agents** to collect data, perform risk analysis, check against regulatory guidelines using a knowledge base, and compile a final, comprehensive report. This solution directly addresses FinSecure's need for accuracy, speed, and auditable compliance, showcasing the transformative power of watsonx Orchestrate in a complex, real-world financial services scenario.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is correctly configured. This is essential for the successful creation and deployment of the agents and tools.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed and configured. Follow the official documentation for [Installing the watsonx Orchestrate ADK](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/getting_started/installing).
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
2.  **Python Environment**: A working Python environment (version 3.10 or later) is required.
3.  **Orchestrate CLI Login**: You must be logged into your watsonx Orchestrate environment via the CLI. If you haven't already, run:
    ```bash
    orchestrate login
    ```
4.  **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated directory for this project to keep all files organized.
    ```bash
    mkdir finsecure_demo
    cd finsecure_demo
    mkdir -p agents tools knowledge_base_docs
    ```

## Step 1: Create the Knowledge Base for Regulatory Guidelines

To ensure all analysis is grounded in current regulations, we will create a knowledge base. This allows the `risk_analysis_agent` to query internal policies and external regulatory documents to validate compliance checks, providing grounded, auditable answers.

First, we'll create a mock regulatory document.

**1.1. Create a Mock Document**

Create a file named `aml_policy_v1.txt` inside the `knowledge_base_docs/` directory.

`knowledge_base_docs/aml_policy_v1.txt`:
```txt
FinSecure Analytics - Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy - v1.2

Section 1: Transaction Monitoring
All transactions exceeding $10,000 USD must be flagged for review. Transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions require enhanced due diligence. A transaction is considered high-risk if its value is over $5,000 and involves entities from jurisdictions on the 'Global Watchlist'.

Section 2: Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)
Any pattern of transactions designed to circumvent the $10,000 threshold (a practice known as 'structuring') must be identified and reported. For example, multiple transactions of $9,500 by the same entity over a short period.

Section 3: Prohibited Activities
Direct or indirect transactions with entities on the official 'Sanctioned Entities List' are strictly prohibited. Any identified transaction must be immediately frozen and reported.
```

**1.2. Define the Knowledge Base YAML**

Create a file named `regulatory_kb.yaml` in the root of your project directory. This file defines the knowledge base, pointing to our document.

`regulatory_kb.yaml`:
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: knowledge_base 
name: regulatory_guidelines_kb
description: >
   Contains FinSecure Analytics' internal compliance policies and external regulatory guidelines.
   This knowledge base is the primary source for answering questions about Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules,
   transaction monitoring thresholds, suspicious activity reporting (SAR) criteria, and lists of sanctioned entities.
documents:
   - "knowledge_base_docs/aml_policy_v1.txt"
vector_index:
   embeddings_model_name: ibm/slate-125m-english-rtrvr-v2
```

**1.3. Import the Knowledge Base**

Run the following command from your project's root directory:
```bash
orchestrate knowledge-bases import -f regulatory_kb.yaml
```

## Step 2: Create the Python Tools

Tools are the building blocks that perform concrete actions. We will create three Python files to logically group our tools: data collection, analysis, and reporting.

**2.1. Create `requirements.txt`**

Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your project. While our mock tools are self-contained, a real-world implementation would use these libraries.
```
requests
python-dotenv
```

**2.2. Data Collection Tools**

These tools simulate fetching raw data from various enterprise systems.

**Business Value**: This demonstrates Orchestrate's ability to act as a data aggregation layer, breaking down data silos by connecting to disparate sources (like a trading database, a CRM, and a market data feed) to create a unified view for analysis.

`tools/data_collection_tools.py`:
```python
import datetime
import random
import uuid
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_trade_data(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> list[dict]:
    """

    trades = []

    client_ids = [f"CUST-{str(i).zfill(3)}" for i in range(1, 11)]
    
    for _ in range(15):  # Generate 15 realistic trade records
        trade_date = datetime.date.fromisoformat(start_date) + datetime.timedelta(days=random.randint(0, 30))
        trades.append({
            "trade_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "client_id": random.choice(client_ids),
