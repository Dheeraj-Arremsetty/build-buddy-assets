# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script
## Xerox Printer Help Bot Implementation

---

## **[OPENING & CONTEXT]** 
*Duration: 2 minutes*

### **Opening Hook**
"Good morning/afternoon! Today, I want to show you how Xerox can transform customer support in just one day - literally. We're going to build a working AI assistant that can handle 50% of your printer support inquiries, right here, right now."

### **Key Talking Points:**
- **Current Reality:** Xerox processes thousands of support requests daily across multiple printer models
- **The Challenge:** Support agents spend 80% of their time answering the same 5 questions repeatedly
- **The Opportunity:** What if we could automate these repetitive queries and free your team to handle complex issues?

### **Transition Statement:**
"Let me show you how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can solve this challenge - not in months, not in weeks, but by the end of this demo."

## **[PROBLEM DEEP DIVE]**
*Duration: 2 minutes*

### **The Support Burden**
"Let's look at your support data:"

**Display Slide: Support Statistics**
- üî¥ **5 questions = 50% of all support chats**
  - "How do I clear a paper jam?"
  - "How do I replace toner?"
  - "How do I restart my printer?"
  - "I need a technician"
  - "Other issues"

- üìä **Cost Impact:**
  - Average chat duration: 8 minutes
  - Cost per chat: $12-15
  - Annual cost for repetitive questions: ~$2.5M

### **Key Message:**
"Your highly skilled support agents are essentially acting as a FAQ database. That's expensive and inefficient."

  2. Provide step-by-step instructions with numbers
  3. Offer to create a service ticket if the issue persists
  4. Be friendly and professional
```

**Narration:**
"Notice how simple this is - we're defining the agent's personality and capabilities in plain English. No complex programming required."

### **Demo Part 2: Adding Knowledge Base** *(2 minutes)*

**Step 2: Import Printer Documentation**
```yaml
knowledge_base:
  - name: xerox_printer_manuals
    documents:
      - "xerox_versalink_manual.pdf"
      - "xerox_altalink_guide.pdf"
      - "common_printer_issues.txt"
```

**Live Action:**
- Drag and drop PDF manuals into the interface
- Show automatic processing and indexing
- "The system is now reading and understanding hundreds of pages of documentation in seconds"

### **Demo Part 3: Creating Tools** *(3 minutes)*

**Step 3: Build the Service Ticket Tool**
```python
# Show this being typed/created
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

@tool
def create_service_ticket(
    customer_email: str,
    printer_model: str,
    issue_description: str
) -> dict:
    """
    Creates a service ticket for complex printer issues
    
    Args:
        customer_email: Customer's email address
        printer_model: Model of the Xerox printer
        issue_description: Detailed description of the issue
    
    Returns:
        Ticket confirmation with ticket number
    """
    # Integration with ServiceNow
    ticket = {
        "ticket_id": "XRX-2024-" + generate_id(),
        "status": "Created",
        "assigned_to": "Next Available Technician",
        "eta": "Within 24 hours"
    }
    return ticket
```

**Key Point:**
"This tool connects directly to your ServiceNow instance. No separate integration project needed."

## **[LIVE DEMO - CUSTOMER INTERACTION]**
*Duration: 3 minutes*

### **Demo Scenario 1: Paper Jam** *(1 minute)*

**[Switch to Chat Interface]**

**Customer:** "My printer has a paper jam"

**Bot Response:**
```
I can help you clear that paper jam. First, can you tell me your printer model? 
If you're not sure, it's usually on the front panel.

For most Xerox printers, here's how to clear a jam:

1. üîå Turn off the printer and unplug it
2. üì§ Open all paper trays and doors
3. üîç Gently remove any visible paper (pull straight out)
4. üîÑ Close all doors and trays
5. ‚ö° Plug in and restart the printer

Did this resolve your issue?
```

### **Demo Scenario 2: Service Ticket Creation** *(1 minute)*

**Customer:** "The paper jam instructions didn't work, still stuck"

**Bot Response:**
```
I understand this is frustrating. Let me create a service ticket for you.

Can you please provide:
- Your email address
- Printer model (if known)

[Customer provides info]

‚úÖ Service ticket created: XRX-2024-7891
A technician will contact you within 24 hours.
Your ticket has been prioritized as "Paper Jam - Unresolved"

Is there anything else I can help with?
```

### **Demo Scenario 3: Complex Issue Handoff** *(1 minute)*

**Customer:** "My printer is making strange noises and printing colors incorrectly"

**Bot Response:**
```
This seems like a complex issue that needs expert attention. 
I'm connecting you with a specialist now.

[Seamless handoff to human agent with full context]

## **[Q&A PREPARATION]**
*Duration: Reserved 3 minutes*

### **Anticipated Questions & Answers:**

**Q1: "What about our existing ServiceNow investment?"**
> "watsonx Orchestrate enhances ServiceNow, not replaces it. We're using ServiceNow's APIs to create tickets automatically. Your existing workflows, SLAs, and processes remain unchanged."

**Q2: "How quickly can we really deploy this?"**
> "The basic bot I just showed you? Today. A production-ready version with your specific printer models and workflows? 3-5 days. Full enterprise rollout with training? 2 weeks maximum."

**Q3: "What if customers prefer human agents?"**
> "They always have that option. The bot can transfer to a human instantly. But our data shows 73% of customers prefer immediate AI help for simple issues versus waiting for an agent."

**Q4: "How do we maintain and update the bot?"**
> "Your business users can update responses and add new scenarios through the no-code interface. When you release new printer models, just upload the manual - the bot learns automatically."

**Q5: "What about security and data privacy?"**
> "watsonx Orchestrate is enterprise-grade with SOC2, ISO 27001 compliance. All data stays within your tenant. No customer data is used for model training."
