# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Sales Process Automation

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building and deploying a sophisticated, multi-agent automation solution on IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The plan is tailored to address the client's specific need for automating their end-to-end sales process. The solution leverages a supervisor agent, the **Sales Orchestrator**, which coordinates a team of specialized agents responsible for data collection, analysis, compliance, and reporting. This architecture streamlines the sales cycle, reduces manual effort, improves data accuracy, ensures regulatory compliance, and provides actionable insights to drive business growth.

By following this plan, you will construct a powerful demonstration that showcases the core capabilities of watsonx Orchestrate, including agent collaboration, custom tool integration, and complex workflow automation. Each component is designed using IBM's documented best practices and the Agent Development Kit (ADK) to ensure a robust and scalable solution.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for the successful development, deployment, and execution of the agents and tools outlined in this plan.

1.  **Python Environment**: A working installation of Python (version 3.9 or later) is required.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit must be installed. If you haven't installed it, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **Orchestrate CLI Authentication**: You must be authenticated to your watsonx Orchestrate environment. If this is your first time, initialize your environment:
    ```bash
    orchestrate environment init --name my-wxo-env
    ```
    Follow the prompts to log in and configure your environment.
4.  **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated project directory to organize your files. We recommend the following structure:
    ```
    sales_automation_demo/
    ├── agents/
    │   ├── 01_sales_data_collector.yaml
    │   ├── 02_sales_analyst.yaml
    │   ├── 03_compliance_officer.yaml
    │   ├── 04_reporting_specialist.yaml
    │   └── 05_sales_orchestrator.yaml
    ├── tools/
    │   ├── 01_data_collection_tools.py
    │   ├── 02_analysis_tools.py
    │   ├── 03_compliance_tools.py
    │   ├── 04_reporting_tools.py
    └── requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Text Editor/IDE**: A code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for editing YAML and Python files.

## Step 1: Create Python Tools for Sales Automation

The foundation of any powerful agent is a robust set of tools. In this step, we will create Python-based tools that perform specific tasks within the sales workflow. Each tool will generate realistic synthetic data to simulate interactions with real-world systems like CRMs, financial databases, and compliance engines.

### 1.1: Data Collection & Processing Tools

These tools are responsible for gathering raw sales data and processing it into a structured format. This simulates fetching data from a CRM or sales database.

**Business Value**: Automating data collection and processing eliminates manual data entry errors, saves significant time for the sales team, and ensures a consistent, clean dataset for analysis and reporting.

**Technical Implementation**: Create a file named `01_data_collection_tools.py` in the `tools/` directory. This file will contain functions to fetch and process sales transaction data.

```python
# tools/01_data_collection_tools.py

import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from uuid import uuid4
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="collect_sales_data", description="Collects recent sales transaction data from the primary CRM system.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def collect_sales_data(days: int = 30) -> str:
    """
    Collects raw sales transaction data from the last specified number of days.
    This simulates fetching data from a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot.

    Args:
        days (int): The number of past days to collect sales data from. Defaults to 30.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of sales transactions. Each transaction includes details like transaction ID, customer information, product, amount, and date.
    """
    transactions = []
    customer_names = ["Innovate Corp", "Quantum Solutions", "Pioneer Tech", "Future Systems", "Nexus Industries"]
    product_names = ["Pro Suite License", "Enterprise Platform", "Standard Package", "Basic Support Plan"]
    
    for _ in range(random.randint(15, 25)): # Generate a realistic number of transactions
        transaction_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=random.randint(1, days))
        transactions.append({
            "transaction_id": str(uuid4()),
            "customer_id": f"CUST-{random.randint(1000, 9999)}",
            "customer_name": random.choice(customer_names),
            "product_id": f"PROD-{random.randint(100, 999)}",
            "product_name": random.choice(product_names),
            "amount": round(random.uniform(500.0, 15000.0), 2),
            "currency": "USD",
            "transaction_date": transaction_date.isoformat(),
            "status": random.choice(["Completed", "Pending", "Failed"])
        })
    return json.dumps({"status": "success", "record_count": len(transactions), "data": transactions})

@tool(name="process_sales_data", description="Processes raw sales data by cleaning, validating, and structuring it for analysis.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def process_sales_data(raw_data: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes a JSON string of raw sales data, cleans it by filtering for completed transactions,
    validates required fields, and adds a processing timestamp.

    Args:
        raw_data (str): A JSON string containing a list of raw sales transactions, typically from the collect_sales_data tool.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string of processed and validated sales data, ready for analysis.
    """
    try:
        data = json.loads(raw_data)
        raw_transactions = data.get("data", [])
        
        processed_records = []
        for record in raw_transactions:
            if record.get("status") == "Completed":
                # Data validation
                if all(k in record for k in ["transaction_id", "customer_name", "amount", "transaction_date"]):
                    record["processed_timestamp"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
                    record["data_quality_score"] = round(random.uniform(0.9, 0.99), 2)
                    processed_records.append(record)
        
        return json.dumps({
            "status": "success",
            "processed_record_count": len(processed_records),
            "data": processed_records
        })
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": "Invalid JSON format for raw_data."})
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": str(e)})

```

### 1.2: Sales Analysis Tools

These tools perform analysis on the processed data to generate insights and forecasts.

**Business Value**: Automated analysis provides sales leaders with immediate, data-driven insights into performance trends and future outlooks without manual spreadsheet work. This enables faster, more informed strategic decision-making.

**Technical Implementation**: Create a file named `02_analysis_tools.py` in the `tools/` directory.

```python
# tools/02_analysis_tools.py

import json
import random
from datetime import datetime
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="analyze_sales_trends", description="Analyzes processed sales data to identify key trends and performance metrics.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def analyze_sales_trends(processed_data: str) -> str:
    """
    Analyzes a JSON string of processed sales data to calculate total revenue, identify the top-performing product,
    and find the customer with the highest total spending.

    Args:
        processed_data (str): A JSON string of processed sales data.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing key performance indicators and sales trends.
    """
    try:
        data = json.loads(processed_data)
        transactions = data.get("data", [])
        if not transactions:
            return json.dumps({"status": "success", "message": "No data to analyze."})

        total_revenue = sum(t['amount'] for t in transactions)
        
        product_sales = {}
        for t in transactions:
            product_sales[t['product_name']] = product_sales.get(t['product_name'], 0) + t['amount']
        top_product = max(product_sales, key=product_sales.get) if product_sales else "N/A"
        
        customer_spending = {}
        for t in transactions:
            customer_spending[t['customer_name']] = customer_spending.get(t['customer_name'], 0) + t['amount']
        top_customer = max(customer_spending, key=customer_spending.get) if customer_spending else "N/A"
        
        analysis = {
            "total_revenue": round(total_revenue, 2),
            "total_transactions": len(transactions),
            "average_transaction_value": round(total
