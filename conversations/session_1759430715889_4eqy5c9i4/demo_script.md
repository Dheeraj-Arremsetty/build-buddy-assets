### **Section 1: Introduction & The Modern Sales Challenge (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with the IBM watsonx Orchestrate team.

Today, we're not just going to talk about technology; we're going to talk about time. Specifically, the time your highly-skilled, highly-paid sales representatives spend *not* selling.

We've spoken with many leaders at [Client Company Name], and a consistent theme has emerged. You have a world-class sales team and a wealth of excellent sales collateral—case studies, whitepapers, presentations, and battle cards. But this content is stored in various places, primarily a large 'Sales Collateral' folder in Box.

This creates a significant challenge, what we call **'Content Chaos.'**

*   **The Problem:** Your sales reps spend, on average, 30% of their time searching for or creating content. They're digging through folders, asking colleagues on Slack, or worse, using outdated materials.
*   **The Business Impact:** This isn't just an inconvenience. It's a direct hit to your bottom line. Every hour spent searching is an hour not spent prospecting, nurturing leads, or closing deals. It leads to inconsistent messaging in the market and can delay critical sales cycles.

What if you could give every single sales rep a dedicated assistant? An expert who has read every piece of collateral, understands its context, and can deliver the perfect asset, summarized and ready to use, in seconds?

That's precisely what we're here to show you today with IBM watsonx Orchestrate."

### **Section 2: The Solution: Your AI-Powered Digital Teammate (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"The solution is an AI agent we've built on watsonx Orchestrate called the **'Sales Content Assistant.'**

Think of it as a new member of your sales team—one that's available 24/7, works inside the tools your team already uses, and has perfect knowledge of your entire content library.

Here’s what it does, and this is our core value proposition:

1.  **Understands Intent:** Your reps ask for what they need in plain, natural language. No more complex keyword searches or navigating confusing folder structures.
2.  **Retrieves with Precision:** The agent connects directly and securely to your Box folder, using it as a trusted knowledge base to find the most relevant documents based on the user's request.
3.  **Summarizes for Speed:** It doesn't just return a list of files. It uses generative AI to provide a concise summary of each document, so the rep knows exactly why it's relevant *before* they even open it.
4.  **Takes Action:** This is the magic of Orchestrate. It goes beyond search and retrieval. The agent can then take the next logical step—drafting an email with the content attached or adding the collateral link directly to a Salesforce opportunity. It automates the *entire* workflow, not just one piece of it.

This turns a 15-minute manual task into a 15-second conversation with an AI assistant. Let's see it in action."

### **Section 3: Live Demo: Putting the Sales Content Assistant to Work (7 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points & Demo Flow)**

"Okay, I'm going to put myself in the shoes of one of your sales reps. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah is preparing for a crucial meeting with a prospective manufacturing client based in Germany. She needs to find the perfect case study to prove our value.

**[DEMO STEP 1: The Initial Request]**

*   **Action:** Open the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface (or an embedded version in Slack/Teams).
*   **Presenter:** "Instead of leaving her workflow to hunt through Box, Sarah simply opens her Sales Content Assistant and types her request in natural language."
*   **Type into chat:** `Find case studies for a manufacturing client in Germany`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent processes the request. After a few seconds, it returns a response.

**[DEMO STEP 2: The Intelligent Response]**

*   **Action:** Showcase the agent's response on screen.
*   **Presenter:** "And here we go. Notice a few key things. First, the assistant has identified the two most relevant documents from your Box knowledge base: 'Future Systems Automotive Supply Chain Optimization' and 'Innovate Corp Industrial Automation Success Story.'
*   **Presenter:** "Second, and more importantly, it has generated a concise summary for each one. Sarah can see at a glance that the 'Future Systems' case study focuses on a 20% efficiency gain, which is a perfect talking point for her meeting. She didn't have to open, skim, and close multiple PDFs to find this."
*   **Presenter:** "Finally, look at the bottom. The agent is proactive. It's asking Sarah what she wants to do next. This is the 'Orchestrate' part of watsonx Orchestrate."

**[DEMO STEP 3: Taking Action - Email]**

*   **Action:** Click the button or type the follow-up command.
*   **Presenter:** "Sarah decides she wants to send the 'Future Systems' case study to the client ahead of the meeting. She can just tell the assistant."
*   **Type into chat:** `Attach the Future Systems case study to a new email for johann.schmidt@future-systems.de`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The system processes the command. A success message appears: "I have drafted an email to johann.schmidt@future-systems.de with the subject 'Relevant Case Study for our Discussion' and attached the document. Please review it in your drafts folder."
*   **Presenter:** "Just like that, the task is done. The email is drafted, the file is attached, and Sarah can move on to her next high-value activity."

**[DEMO STEP 4: A More Complex, Conversational Request]**

*   **Action:** Continue the conversation with the agent.
*   **Presenter:** "But now Sarah wants to log this activity and the relevant content in her CRM to keep her opportunity record up-to-date. She continues the conversation."
*   **Type into chat:** `Great. Now add the link for the Innovate Corp case study to the Salesforce opportunity 'Future Systems Q4 Deal'`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent processes the command and interacts with the Salesforce tool. A success message appears: "Done. I have added the link to the 'Innovate Corp Industrial Automation Success Story' in the notes section of the 'Future Systems Q4 Deal' opportunity in Salesforce."
*   **Presenter:** "And there you have it. In under two minutes, Sarah has found two perfect assets, sent one to a client, and updated her CRM with the other—all without ever leaving this single interface. This is how you give your sales team superpowers."

### **Section 4: How It Works: The Technology Behind the Magic (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points - Keep it high-level and business-focused)**

"What you just saw looks simple, and that's the goal. But it's powered by a sophisticated, three-part architecture within watsonx Orchestrate.

**[Show a simple diagram: Agent -> Knowledge Base -> Tools]**

1.  **The Agent (The Brains):** This is our **Sales Content Assistant**, a native agent built using the Orchestrate ADK. It's powered by one of IBM's Granite models running on watsonx.ai. Its job is to understand Sarah's intent, maintain context in the conversation, and decide which capability to use. We define its persona and instructions in a simple YAML file.

2.  **The Knowledge Base (The Memory):** We securely connected Orchestrate to your 'Sales Collateral' folder in Box. Orchestrate ingests the documents and creates a vector index—think of it as a highly sophisticated digital map of your content. This allows the agent to perform semantic searches, finding documents based on meaning and context, not just keywords.

3.  **The Tools (The Hands):** This is where action happens. We've equipped the agent with custom tools built using the Orchestrate Python ADK.
    *   One tool connects to your email gateway (like Microsoft 365) to draft emails.
    *   Another tool connects to the Salesforce API to update opportunities.
    *   These are simple, reusable Python functions that allow the agent to interact with the outside world and complete tasks in your core business systems.

This combination of a powerful LLM, a grounded knowledge base, and actionable tools is what makes Orchestrate a true enterprise automation platform."

### **Section 5: Business Impact, ROI, and Q&A (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"So, let's tie this back to the business value.

*   **Increased Productivity:** If each of your 500 sales reps reclaims just 30 minutes per day, that's over **60,000 hours** of selling time given back to the business annually.
*   **Increased Effectiveness:** Reps use the best, most current content every time, leading to more compelling conversations and higher win rates.
*   **Faster Onboarding:** New hires can become productive almost instantly. They don't need to learn your folder structure; they just need to ask.
*   **Governance and Consistency:** You ensure that only approved, on-brand messaging is being used across your entire global sales force.

The ROI isn't just in time saved; it's in deals won and revenue generated.

With that, I'd like to open it up for any questions you may have."

### **Anticipated Q&A**

*   **Q: How secure is this? Our sales collateral is confidential.**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. watsonx Orchestrate is built on IBM Cloud, which provides enterprise-grade security. Your data is yours. The connection to Box uses secure authentication, and the knowledge base is isolated to your environment. We can enforce role-based access to ensure only authorized users can access the agent.

*   **Q: How long does it take to build something like this?**
    *   **A:** This is the power of the platform and the Agent Development Kit (ADK). For a defined use case like this, we can go from concept to a working prototype in a matter of weeks, not months. The ADK accelerates the process of creating the agent, connecting the knowledge base, and building the tools.

*   **Q: Can this connect to other systems besides Box and Salesforce?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely. The tool-based architecture is designed for extensibility. We have pre-built connectors for many popular apps, and the Python ADK allows us to build custom tools to connect to virtually any system with an API, whether it's an internal database, a legacy system, or another SaaS application.

*   **Q: What about different languages or regions? Our content is global.**
    *   **A:** The underlying watsonx models support multiple languages. We can configure the agent and knowledge base to handle multilingual queries and content, ensuring your teams in Germany, Japan, or Brazil get the same seamless experience.
