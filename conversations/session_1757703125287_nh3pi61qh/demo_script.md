### **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: Accelerating Xerox's Reinvention**

**Target Audience:** Xerox Business & IT Leaders (Workflow Automation, Digital Services, IT Operations)
**Demo Duration:** 20 Minutes
**Presenter:** IBM watsonx Orchestrate Specialist

### **Part 1: Setting the Stage (3 minutes)**

**(0:00 - 1:30) | Opening & Aligning with Xerox's Strategy**

**Presenter:** "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. We've been following Xerox's 'Reinvention' strategy with great interest, particularly your strategic pivot towards becoming a leader in workplace technology and digital services. We understand the challenge of transforming a legacy business while simultaneously driving new growth in areas like workflow automation and IT services.

Your focus on leveraging your established enterprise relationships to sell higher-margin digital solutions is exactly where the market is headed. We also recognize the significant investment you're making in your own AI capabilities, like the Xerox Agent Builder.

Today, we're not here to talk about replacing that. We're here to show you how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can act as an enterprise-grade accelerator for that vision—a platform to build, manage, and scale a true digital workforce that automates complex processes across your entire organization and for your customers."

**Key Messages:**
*   We understand your business and strategic direction ("Reinvention").
*   We acknowledge and respect your existing AI initiatives (Agent Builder).
*   We are positioning Orchestrate as a complementary, enterprise-grade accelerator, not a replacement.

**(1:30 - 3:00) | The Problem: The "Last Mile" of Productivity**

**Presenter:** "Your 'Reinvention' is centered on automating workflows. But we often see a critical challenge: the 'hidden work' that bogs down your most valuable employees. Think about your field technicians who are the face of your Managed Print and IT Services. Every day, they perform high-value work—fixing complex equipment, ensuring customer uptime.

But what happens after the job is done? They have to stop, pull out a laptop or tablet, log into a system like ServiceNow, and manually fill out a detailed service ticket. It might only be 5-10 minutes, but multiply that by thousands of technicians and hundreds of service calls a year. That's thousands of hours of lost productivity. It's time spent on low-value administrative tasks instead of moving to the next customer.

This manual, repetitive work is the 'last mile' of productivity that traditional automation struggles to solve. It’s the gap between systems, and it’s where efficiency goes to die."

**Key Messages:**
*   Frame the problem around a relatable persona: the Xerox field technician.
*   Quantify the pain: "thousands of hours of lost productivity."
*   Define the challenge as the "hidden work" or "last mile" that is difficult to automate.

### **Part 2: The Solution & Live Demo (10 minutes)**

**(3:00 - 4:30) | Solution: Introducing Digital Labor with watsonx Orchestrate**

**Presenter:** "This is precisely the problem watsonx Orchestrate is designed to solve. Think of it as a platform for creating and managing **Digital Labor**. We empower you to build AI-powered agents—digital employees—that can understand natural language, use tools to interact with your existing applications, and automate those frustrating, manual tasks.

For your technicians, this means turning a 10-minute form-filling exercise into a 10-second conversation. For your business, it means accelerating service delivery, improving data accuracy, and freeing up your best people to do what they do best.

Today, we're going to show you a simple but powerful example. We've built an agent called `ServiceLogAgent`. Its one job is to help field technicians log service tickets in ServiceNow instantly, using nothing but their voice or a simple text message."

**Value Proposition:**
*   **Automate the Unstructured:** Handle tasks initiated by natural language.
*   **Augment Your Workforce:** Give every employee a digital assistant.
*   **Connect Your Systems:** Bridge the gap between applications like ServiceNow, SAP, and others without complex integrations.

**(4:30 - 9:30) | LIVE DEMO: The `ServiceLogAgent` in Action**

**Presenter:** *[Shares screen showing the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface]*

"Okay, let's put ourselves in the shoes of Sarah, one of your field technicians. She just finished replacing a faulty fuser unit on a multifunction printer at a customer site.

**The OLD way:** Sarah would now have to stop, find her laptop, log in, navigate to ServiceNow, open a new incident form, and manually type in the customer name, device serial number, description of the work, and parts used. It's cumbersome and prone to typos.

**The NEW way with watsonx Orchestrate:** Sarah simply opens her Orchestrate app."

---
**DEMO STEP 1: Natural Language Request**

*   **Action:** Presenter types a simple, conversational prompt into the chat interface.
*   **What to Type:**
    `"I just finished the fuser unit replacement for the Xerox PrimeLink at Acme Corp's downtown office. The device serial is VXM-459871. Log a service ticket for the completed work."`
*   **What to Say:** "Sarah doesn't need to know any special commands or syntax. She just describes what she did in her own words, just like she was talking to a colleague. She includes the key details: the work performed, the customer, the device, and the serial number."

---
**DEMO STEP 2: Agent Understanding and Tool Execution**

*   **Action:** The screen will show Orchestrate processing the request. The `ServiceLogAgent` will be identified, and it will show that it is preparing to use the `create_service_ticket` tool.
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent will correctly parse the unstructured text, extracting the key entities:
    *   `Customer:` Acme Corp
    *   `Device:` Xerox PrimeLink
    *   `Serial Number:` VXM-459871
    *   `Description:` "Completed fuser unit replacement."
*   **What to Say:** "Now, watch what happens. Orchestrate's powerful language model instantly understands the intent. It recognizes that Sarah wants to log a ticket and has identified all the critical pieces of information from her sentence. It has automatically selected our `ServiceLogAgent` and is now using its specialized tool, `create_service_ticket`, to connect to ServiceNow in the background."

---
**DEMO STEP 3: Confirmation and Completion**

*   **Action:** The agent completes the task and responds in the chat.
*   **Expected Outcome:** A confirmation message appears in the chat interface.
    `"Success! I've created a service ticket in ServiceNow. The incident number is INC0012345. Is there anything else I can help you with?"`
*   **What to Say:** "And just like that, it's done. In seconds. The ticket is created in ServiceNow, accurately and instantly. Sarah gets a confirmation with the incident number for her records and can immediately pack up and head to her next client. We've just reclaimed 10 minutes of her day. Scale that across your entire field service organization, and the impact on productivity is immense."

**(9:30 - 11:00) | How It Works: A Quick Look Under the Hood**

**Presenter:** "So what did we just see? It's not magic, it's a combination of three key components."

*   **The Agent (`ServiceLogAgent`):** "This is the digital worker we built. It's defined by a name, a description of its capabilities, and instructions on how to behave. It's the brain of the operation."
*   **The Tool (`create_service_ticket`):** "This is the agent's skill. It's a simple piece of Python code that knows how to securely connect to the ServiceNow API and create an incident. You can build tools to connect to any system with an API—SAP, Workday, Salesforce, or your own internal applications."
*   **The Agent Development Kit (ADK):** "This is *how* you build these agents and tools. It's a developer-friendly framework that allows your teams to use standard languages like Python and simple YAML files to rapidly create, test, and deploy new digital workers. This is where we see a powerful synergy with your Agent Builder. The ADK provides the enterprise scaffolding to build robust, scalable, and *orchestratable* agents that can be managed and governed centrally."

**(11:00 - 13:00) | Business Value & ROI**

**Presenter:** "Let's translate those 10 minutes saved into tangible business value for Xerox."

*   **Increased Productivity & Efficiency:**
    *   "If a technician saves just 30 minutes per day, that's over 120 hours per year, per technician. That's three full weeks of productive time returned to the business. This means more service calls completed and higher customer satisfaction."
*   **Improved Data Accuracy:**
    *   "Automating data entry eliminates human error, leading to cleaner data in your service systems. This means more reliable reporting, better analytics for preventative maintenance, and more accurate billing."
*   **Enhanced Employee Experience:**
    *   "You empower your expert technicians to focus on high-value technical work, not tedious admin tasks. This improves job satisfaction and retention of your top talent."
*   **New Revenue Opportunities:**
    *   "Imagine packaging these automated workflows as a premium offering for your Managed Workplace Services customers. You're not just managing their devices; you're actively automating their business processes. This aligns perfectly with your shift to higher-margin digital services."

### **Part 3: Q&A and Next Steps (5 minutes)**

**(13:00 - 18:00) | Prepared Q&A**

**Presenter:** "I'd like to open it up for questions, but let me anticipate a few common ones."

**Q1: How is this different from our own Xerox Agent Builder?**
> **A:** "That's an excellent question. We see them as highly complementary. Agent Builder is great for creating specific AI-powered agents. watsonx Orchestrate is the enterprise platform to *run, manage, and scale* them. The key differentiator is in the name: **Orchestration**. Orchestrate is designed to be a supervisor, capable of routing complex tasks to multiple different agents—some built by you, some provided by IBM, some from our partners. It provides the governance, security, and connectivity framework to build a true, interconnected digital workforce, not just a collection of standalone bots."

**Q2: How does this handle security and connect to our systems?**
> **A:** "Security is paramount. All connections are managed through secure, encrypted channels. Our ADK allows you to build tools that use standard authentication methods like OAuth and API keys, which you control. We inherit the robust security and governance of the entire watsonx platform, ensuring your data remains your data."

**Q3: How complex is it to build a new agent like the one you just showed?**
> **A:** "For a developer familiar with Python and APIs, an agent like the `ServiceLogAgent` can be built and tested in a matter of hours, not weeks. The ADK is designed for rapid development. The provided `Execution Plan` documentation shows the exact Python and YAML code needed—it's surprisingly straightforward."

**Q4: Can this do more than just create tickets? Can it handle complex, multi-step processes?**
> **A:** "Absolutely. This was a simple example. We can build agents that perform multi-step sequences. For example: 'Look up the warranty status for serial number XYZ, then create a service ticket, and finally, order the replacement part from our SAP system.' That's the power of orchestration—chaining skills and agents together to automate an entire end-to-end process."

**(18:00 - 20:00) | Next Steps & Call to Action**

**Presenter:** "What we've shown you today is just the tip of the iceberg. We believe watsonx Orchestrate can be a key enabler for Xerox's 'Reinvention,' helping you improve your own internal efficiency and create innovative new digital services for your customers.

As a next step, we'd like to propose a hands-on discovery workshop with your workflow automation team. We can identify one of your high-value, high-friction internal processes and, in just a few days, build a working proof-of-concept agent to demonstrate the power of this platform on a problem that matters to you.

Thank you again for your time. We're excited about the possibility of partnering with you on your transformation journey."
