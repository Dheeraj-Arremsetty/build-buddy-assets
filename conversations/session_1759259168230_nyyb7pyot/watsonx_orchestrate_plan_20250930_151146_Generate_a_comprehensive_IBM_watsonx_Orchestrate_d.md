# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Nespresso Boutique AI Concierge

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building and deploying a sophisticated, multi-agent "Nespresso Boutique AI Concierge" using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. This solution is tailored to the client's goal of elevating the luxury retail experience by providing customers with an intelligent, conversational AI that can handle a wide range of inquiries. The concierge will act as a central supervisor, delegating tasks to specialized agents for product recommendations, real-time inventory checks, customer loyalty management, and technical support. This architecture demonstrates the power of watsonx Orchestrate to create complex, collaborative AI systems that integrate with various business functions, ultimately driving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency for a premium brand like Nespresso.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is properly configured.

1.  **Python:** Python 3.10 or later must be installed.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK):** The ADK must be installed and configured. If not installed, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **ADK Environment:** You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment initialized. If you haven't done so, run `orchestrate env init` and follow the prompts to connect to your watsonx Orchestrate instance.
4.  **Text Editor/IDE:** A code editor such as Visual Studio Code is recommended for creating and editing YAML and Python files.

## Step 1: Project Setup and Directory Structure

First, we will create a structured directory to organize all the assets for our demo. This ensures a clean and manageable project.

1.  Create a root folder for the project:
    ```bash
    mkdir nespresso_demo
    cd nespresso_demo
    ```

2.  Create subdirectories for agents, tools, knowledge bases, and documentation:
    ```bash
    mkdir agents tools knowledge_bases docs
    ```

3.  Create placeholder document files for the knowledge bases. These files should contain relevant text that the knowledge base can ingest.
    ```bash
    # For Product Knowledge Base
    touch docs/nespresso_vertuo_catalog.pdf
    touch docs/nespresso_original_catalog.pdf

    # For Support Knowledge Base
    touch docs/vertuo_plus_manual.pdf
    touch docs/common_troubleshooting_guide.pdf
    ```
    **Note:** For a real demo, populate these PDFs with actual content from Nespresso's website or internal documentation.

4.  Create a `requirements.txt` file to list the Python dependencies for our tools.
    ```bash
    touch requirements.txt
    ```
    Add the following content to `requirements.txt`. We are including `requests` as it is a common dependency for tools that might call external APIs.
    ```text
    # requirements.txt
    requests
    ```

## Step 2: Create and Import Knowledge Bases

Knowledge bases provide the agents with grounded information from trusted documents, such as product catalogs and troubleshooting manuals. This is crucial for providing accurate and consistent answers.

### 2.1. Nespresso Product Knowledge Base

This knowledge base will contain detailed product information, enabling the `product_advisor_agent` to answer questions about coffee profiles and machine specifications.

1.  Create the file `knowledge_bases/nespresso_product_kb.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    # knowledge_bases/nespresso_product_kb.yaml
    spec_version: v1
    kind: knowledge_base 
    name: nespresso_product_kb
    description: >
      Contains detailed information about Nespresso coffee capsules, including tasting notes, intensity, origin, and recommended cup sizes, as well as specifications for Vertuo and Original line machines. Use this to answer any specific questions about coffee or machine features.
    documents:
      - "docs/nespresso_vertuo_catalog.pdf"
      - "docs/nespresso_original_catalog.pdf"
    vector_index:
      embeddings_model_name: ibm/slate-125m-english-rtrvr-v2
    ```

### 2.2. Nespresso Support Knowledge Base

This knowledge base will store troubleshooting guides and user manuals, allowing the `support_agent` to provide step-by-step assistance for machine issues.
