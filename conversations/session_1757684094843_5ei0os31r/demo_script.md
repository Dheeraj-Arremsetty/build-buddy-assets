### **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: The 'Barista Buddy' Agent**

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Demo Specialist Name]
**Audience:** Starbucks Innovation, Operations, and IT Leadership
**Time Allotment:** 15-20 Minutes

---

### **Section 1: Opening & Understanding Your Business (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 1: Title - Reimagining the Starbucks Experience with Digital Labor)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Good morning, and thank you for your time. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with IBM watsonx. We're here today because we recognize Starbucks isn't just a coffee company; you're a global leader in customer experience, the creators of the 'third place'."
*   "We've done our homework. Our own analysis, using watsonx's Deep Search capabilities, highlighted your incredible strengths—your premium brand, your powerful digital ecosystem, and your innovative spirit."
*   "That same analysis also pinpointed the challenges that come with that scale and complexity. Specifically, the report notes that the growing popularity of complex, customized beverages has increased strain on employees and can slow down service times, impacting store efficiency."
*   "This is the precise challenge we want to help you solve today. How can you empower every barista, from their first day to their tenth year, to deliver that perfect, consistent Starbucks experience, every single time, without missing a beat?"

### **Section 2: The Problem Statement: The Operational Complexity Challenge (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 2: Image of a busy Starbucks counter with a barista looking stressed)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Let's imagine a barista, we'll call her Sarah. It's 8:30 AM on a Tuesday. The line is growing. A mobile order comes in for a new seasonal drink she's only made twice. The next customer wants to know the ingredients in the Oleato cold brew. The person after that wants to process a complex mobile order return."
*   "In that moment, Sarah has to recall specific training, consult a printed guide, or ask a manager for help. Each of those actions adds seconds, and during peak hours, those seconds multiply across thousands of stores. This creates a bottleneck."
*   **Key Message:** "This isn't a training problem; it's an information access problem. The operational complexity that drives your menu innovation and personalization is creating friction at your most critical point of service."
*   "This friction can lead to slower service, reduced order throughput, inconsistent quality, and increased employee stress. The very innovation that delights your customers can, if not managed perfectly, strain your operations."

### **Section 3: The Solution: The 'Barista Buddy' powered by watsonx Orchestrate (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 3: Graphic showing the watsonx Orchestrate logo connected to a POS terminal icon and a headset icon)**

**Value Proposition:**

*   "We propose a solution: a 'Barista Buddy,' a specialized AI agent built on IBM watsonx Orchestrate. Think of it as your most experienced barista and operations manager, digitized and available to every employee, instantly, on their POS terminal or through a headset."
*   "The 'Barista Buddy' is a form of **Digital Labor**. It's not just a chatbot; it's a digital team member that can understand natural language, access specific knowledge, and use tools to complete tasks."
*   "With this agent, Sarah could simply ask:
    *   *'What are the ingredients and build steps for the new Oleato cold brew?'*
    *   *'How do I process a mobile order return for a Gold member?'*
    *   *'A customer wants a grande cold brew with 3 pumps of sugar-free vanilla in a venti cup with extra ice. How do I ring that up?'*"
*   **Key Message:** "By providing instant, accurate answers and guidance, we can turn moments of hesitation into moments of confident, efficient service. This is about empowering your employees to match the speed and quality your customers expect."

### **Section 4: Live Demo: Building and Using the 'Barista Buddy' (6 Minutes)**

**(Presenter switches to a live demo environment)**

"Let me show you how we would actually build and deploy the 'Barista Buddy.' The magic of watsonx Orchestrate is how quickly we can assemble these powerful agents using simple, reusable components."

**Demo Step 1: The Foundation - Knowledge (1.5 mins)**

*   **Action:** Show two text files. One named `oleato_recipe.txt` and another `mobile_return_policy.txt`.
*   **Talking Points:** "Everything starts with trusted information. Here are two simple documents: one contains the official recipe and allergen info for the Oleato, and the other details your mobile return policy. This is your 'source of truth'."
*   **Action:** Show the Knowledge Base YAML file (`barista_kb.yaml`).
*   **Talking Points:** "Using our Agent Development Kit, or ADK, we create a Knowledge Base. This YAML file is incredibly simple. We just give it a name—'Barista Knowledge Base'—and point it to the documents we want it to learn from. With one command, Orchestrate ingests this information, making it securely searchable."

```yaml
# DEMO SCRIPT - barista_kb.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: knowledge_base 
name: barista_knowledge_base
description: Contains official Starbucks recipes, policies, and operational procedures.
documents:
   - "knowledge_base_docs/oleato_recipe.txt"
   - "knowledge_base_docs/mobile_return_policy.txt"
```

**Demo Step 2: The Action - Tools (1.5 mins)**

*   **Action:** Show a Python file named `pos_tools.py`.
*   **Talking Points:** "Next, we give the agent the ability to *do* things. This is a Python tool. Notice the `@tool` decorator and the clear description. This docstring is critical—it's how the AI understands what the tool does, what inputs it needs, and what it returns. This tool simulates looking up a complex order in your POS system."

```python
# DEMO SCRIPT - pos_tools.py
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

@tool
def lookup_complex_order_code(drink: str, modifications: list[str]) -> dict:
    """
    Looks up the correct Point-of-Sale (POS) code and pricing for a complex, customized beverage order.
    
    Args:
        drink (str): The base beverage, e.g., 'Cold Brew'.
        modifications (list[str]): A list of customer modifications, e.g., ['sugar-free vanilla', 'extra ice', 'in a venti cup'].

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the POS code, itemized list, and final price.
    """
    # In a real scenario, this would call the Starbucks POS API.
    # For the demo, we return a mock response.
    return {
        "pos_code": "SKU-4B7-9C1",
        "summary": "Grande Cold Brew w/ mods",
        "price": "$5.75"
    }
```

**Demo Step 3: The Assembly - The Agent (1 min)**

*   **Action:** Show the `barista_buddy_agent.yaml` file.
*   **Talking Points:** "Finally, we assemble the agent. This YAML file defines the 'Barista Buddy.' We give it a name, a description, and simple instructions on how to behave. Most importantly, we connect the `barista_knowledge_base` and the `pos_tools` we just created. This is the entire definition of our digital worker."

```yaml
# DEMO SCRIPT - barista_buddy_agent.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: barista_buddy
description: An expert assistant for Starbucks baristas. It can answer questions about recipes, policies, and use POS tools to handle complex orders.
instructions: >
  You are a helpful and efficient assistant for Starbucks baristas. 
  Use the knowledge base for questions about recipes and policies.
  Use your tools for tasks related to the POS system.
  Keep your answers clear, concise, and friendly.
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
tools:
  - lookup_complex_order_code
knowledge_base:
  - barista_knowledge_base
```

**Demo Step 4: 'Barista Buddy' in Action (2 mins)**

*   **Action:** Open the Orchestrate chat interface.
*   **Presenter Prompt 1 (Knowledge Base Query):** "Let's test it. I'll ask a simple question."
    > **`What are the ingredients in the Oleato Gingerbread Oatmilk Latte?`**
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds with a perfectly formatted list of ingredients, citing the `oleato_recipe.txt` document as its source.
*   **Presenter Prompt 2 (Tool Use Query):** "Now for a more complex task."
    > **`A customer wants a grande cold brew with sugar-free vanilla, extra ice, in a venti cup. How do I ring that up?`**
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent identifies this as a task for its tool. It responds: "I can help with that. The POS code is SKU-4B7-9C1, and the total price is $5.75."
*   **Talking Points:** "Notice what happened. For the first question, it used its knowledge base to provide a factual, grounded answer. For the second, it understood the user's intent, identified the correct tool, and executed it to provide a structured, actionable answer. No ambiguity, no guesswork."

### **Section 5: Business Value & ROI (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 4: Icons for Speed, Quality, Employee Satisfaction, and Scalability with metrics)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "So, what does this mean for your business? Let's translate this capability into tangible value."
*   **Faster Service & Higher Throughput:** "By shaving just 15-20 seconds off every complex order or question, a single store can serve dozens of extra customers during a morning rush. Across 38,000 stores, this translates to a significant lift in revenue."
*   **Consistent Quality & Brand Promise:** "Every barista, on day one, has the knowledge of a ten-year veteran. This ensures every drink is made to spec, every time, protecting the premium brand image you've worked so hard to build."
*   **Employee Empowerment & Retention:** "Confident employees are happy employees. By removing sources of stress and friction, you create a better work environment, which can directly impact employee satisfaction and reduce costly turnover."
*   **Unmatched Agility & Scale:** "When you launch a new menu, you can update the 'Barista Buddy's' knowledge base once, and instantly, every single barista across the globe has the new information. Your speed of innovation is no longer limited by the speed of training."

### **Section 6: Q&A Preparation (Anticipated Questions)**

**(Slide 5: Q&A)**

*   **Q1: How does this integrate with our proprietary POS and inventory systems?**
    *   **A:** "Orchestrate is built for integration. As we showed with the Python tool, it can connect to any system with an API. We would work with your team to wrap your existing APIs into secure, reusable tools that the agent can use, just like the one in the demo."
*   **Q2: How do you ensure the AI doesn't 'hallucinate' or give incorrect answers?**
    *   **A:** "This is a critical point. Our approach is built on two principles: **Grounding** and **Determinism**. For informational queries, the agent is grounded in your trusted documents in the Knowledge Base (a technique called RAG). For actions, it uses deterministic tools that perform specific, pre-defined tasks. This combination gives you the flexibility of natural language with the reliability of traditional software."
*   **Q3: How is our sensitive data, like recipes, kept secure?**
    *   **A:** "Security is paramount. IBM watsonx can be deployed in your secure Virtual Private Cloud or on-premise, ensuring your proprietary data never leaves your control. All interactions are governed by watsonx.governance, providing a full audit trail and lineage for every query and response."

### **Section 7: Next Steps & Call to Action (1 Minute)**

**(Slide 6: Next Steps)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "What we've shown you today is a powerful, yet achievable, vision for the future of your store operations."
*   "Our proposal is a collaborative, two-week **Proof of Concept workshop**. We'll work directly with your operations and IT teams to build a functional 'Barista Buddy' prototype focused on one of your most complex menu items or operational procedures."
*   "The goal is to demonstrate, in your own environment with your own data, the tangible impact this technology can have on your speed of service and employee experience."
*   "Thank you for your time. I'll now open it up for any further questions."
