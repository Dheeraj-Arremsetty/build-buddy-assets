# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: "Empower" Employee Success Agent

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building and deploying the "Empower" agent, a sophisticated virtual assistant for your client's employees. The Empower agent is designed to address common enterprise challenges where employees face fragmented information silos and slow response times for HR, benefits, and IT support. By acting as a central supervisor, the Empower agent intelligently routes employee inquiries to specialized collaborator agents—`customer_care_agent` for healthcare and benefits questions, and `service_now_agent` for IT incident management. This multi-agent architecture demonstrates the power of watsonx Orchestrate to create scalable, maintainable, and highly capable AI assistants that streamline internal processes, reduce administrative overhead, and significantly improve the employee experience. This demo will showcase a tangible solution to the client's need for a unified and efficient internal support system.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is properly configured. This is essential for the successful creation and deployment of the agents and tools outlined in this plan.

*   **Python:** Python 3.9 or later must be installed on your system.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK:** The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is the core tool for building and managing Orchestrate assets. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
*   **Orchestrate CLI Configuration:** You must configure the CLI to connect to your watsonx Orchestrate instance. This typically involves setting environment variables or using the `orchestrate config set` command with your credentials.
*   **Project Directory:** A dedicated folder to organize all configuration files and code.
*   **Text Editor:** A code editor such as Visual Studio Code is recommended for editing YAML and Python files.

## Step 1: Project Setup

A well-organized project structure is crucial for managing the different components of your solution. Create the following directory structure to house the agents and tools.

1.  Create a main project folder named `empower_demo`.
2.  Inside `empower_demo`, create two subfolders: `agents` and `tools`.
3.  Inside `tools`, create two more subfolders: `customer_care` and `service_now`.

Your final directory structure should look like this:

```
empower_demo/
├── agents/
│   ├── customer_care_agent.yaml
│   ├── service_now_agent.yaml
│   └── empower_agent.yaml
├── tools/
│   ├── customer_care/
│   │   ├── get_healthcare_benefits.py
│   │   ├── get_my_claims.py
│   │   └── search_healthcare_providers.py
│   └── service_now/
│       ├── create_service_now_incident.py
│       ├── get_my_service_now_incidents.py
│       └── get_service_now_incident_by_number.py
└── requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Create the Tools

Tools are the foundational components that perform actions. We will create two sets of tools: one for customer care (healthcare/benefits) and one for ServiceNow (IT incidents). Each tool will be a self-contained Python script with realistic synthetic data to simulate real-world API interactions.

### Customer Care Tools

These tools handle inquiries related to healthcare plans, claims, and provider lookups.

#### 1. Healthcare Benefits Tool

**Business Value:** This tool provides immediate, on-demand access to complex health plan details. It empowers employees to self-serve and compare benefits, reducing the workload on HR personnel and improving decision-making during open enrollment or when life events occur.

**Technical Implementation:** The `get_healthcare_benefits.py` tool simulates fetching data from a benefits administration system. It uses Pydantic models for structured input (`Plan`) and makes a (mocked) request to an external service.

**File:** `empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py`

```python
# empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py
from enum import Enum
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission
import requests

class Plan(str, Enum):
    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'
    PPO = 'PPO'

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_healthcare_benefits(plan: Plan, in_network: bool = None):
    """Retrieves a comprehensive list of health benefits data, organized by coverage type and plan variant.

    This data includes details such as annual deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and various co-pays or
    percentages for medical services under different network plans (HDHP, HDHP Plus, and PPO).

    Args:
        plan (str, optional): The plan the user is currently on. Can be one of "HDHP", "HDHP Plus", or "PPO".
            If not provided, all plans will be returned.
        in_network (bool, optional): Whether the user wants coverage for in-network or out-of-network.
            If not provided, both will be returned.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains benefit details for the specified plan(s).
    """
    # In a real scenario, this would call a real API. We use a mock service for the demo.
    try:
        resp = requests.get(
            'https://get-benefits-data.1sqnxi8zv3dh.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/',
            params={
                'plan': plan,
                'in_network': in_network
            }
        )
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return resp.json()['benefits']
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return {"error": "Failed to retrieve benefits data", "details": str(e)}

```

#### 2. Claims Status Tool

**Business Value:** This tool provides employees with instant visibility into the status of their medical claims. This transparency reduces anxiety and follow-up inquiries, freeing up HR and benefits staff to focus on more strategic tasks.

**Technical Implementation:** The `get_my_claims.py` tool generates a static list of synthetic claim data, representing various statuses (Processed, Pending, Rejected). This mimics a query to a claims processing backend.

**File:** `empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_my_claims.py`

```python
# empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_my_claims.py
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_my_claims() -> list[dict]:
    """Retrieves detailed information about submitted medical claims for the current user.

    The details include claim status, submission and processing dates, amounts claimed and approved,
    provider information, and services included in the claims.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, each containing details about a specific claim.
    """
    # Synthetic data for demonstration purposes
    claims_data = [
        {
            "claimId": "CLM1234567",
            "submittedDate": (datetime
