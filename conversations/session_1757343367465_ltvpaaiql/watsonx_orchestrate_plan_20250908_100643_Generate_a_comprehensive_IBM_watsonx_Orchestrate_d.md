# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan

## Overview

This execution plan is crafted to facilitate Xerox in deploying a robust customer service agent template system using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The solution is designed to enable rapid deployment of customized customer service chatbots across different industries, significantly reducing setup time while maintaining high-quality service delivery. The architecture includes a Master Template Agent, a Customization Agent, and an Escalation Agent, each performing specific tasks to enhance customer service operations. The demo will use synthetic data to simulate real-world scenarios, showcasing the system's capabilities in a controlled environment.

## Prerequisites

To successfully implement this solution, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK Setup**: Install the latest version of the IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK to facilitate agent and tool development.
   - Command: `pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate==1.7.0`

2. **Development Environment**: Set up the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Developer Edition for local testing and development.
   - Ensure that the environment is configured with the necessary permissions and credentials.

3. **Synthetic Data Preparation**: Prepare mock data for FAQs, order statuses, and support tickets to mimic client scenarios.

4. **Development Tools**: Utilize a text editor such as Visual Studio Code for editing YAML and Python files.

5. **Command-Line Interface Access**: Ensure you have access to a terminal or command prompt to execute CLI commands for managing agents and tools.

6. **Requirements File**: Create a `requirements.txt` file with necessary Python packages to manage dependencies.

## Step 1: Create YAML Configuration

### Master Template Agent

The Master Template Agent is the core of the customer service system, equipped with functionalities essential for handling customer inquiries, tracking orders, and managing support tickets.

#### Business Value

tools:
  - human_transfer_tool
```

## Step 2: Create Tools

For this solution, each tool is designed to perform specific tasks that enhance the customer service process. The tools are implemented using IBM's `@tool` decorator with appropriate permissions and realistic synthetic data.

### FAQ Responder Tool

#### Purpose and Business Value

The FAQ Responder tool quickly addresses common customer inquiries, reducing the workload on human agents and improving response times.

#### Technical Implementation

```python
# faq_responder.py
import json
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="faq_responder", description="Handles FAQ queries", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def faq_responder(query: str) -> str:
    """Responds to FAQ queries using predefined answers.

    Args:
        query (str): The FAQ query from the customer.

    Returns:
        str: The response to the FAQ query.
    """
    faq_data = {
        "What is your return policy?": "Our return policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase.",
        "How can I track my order?": "You can track your order using the tracking number sent to your email."
    }
    return faq_data.get(query, "I'm sorry, I don't have an answer for that.")
```

### Order Status Checker Tool

#### Purpose and Business Value

This tool enables customers to track their orders in real-time, enhancing transparency and customer satisfaction.

#### Technical Implementation

```python
# order_status_checker.py
import json
import random
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="order_status_checker", description="Checks the status of orders", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def order_status_checker(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Provides the current status of an order based on its ID.

    Args:
        order_id (str): The unique identifier for the order.

    Returns:
        str: The current status of the order.
    """
    statuses = ["Processing", "Shipped", "Delivered", "Cancelled"]
    return json.dumps({"order_id": order_id, "status": random.choice(statuses)})
```

### Support Ticket Creator Tool

#### Purpose and Business Value

Facilitates the creation of support tickets, ensuring customer issues are documented and addressed promptly.

#### Technical Implementation

```python
# support_ticket_creator.py
import json
import random
import datetime
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="support_ticket_creator", description="Creates support tickets", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def support_ticket_creator(issue_description: str) -> str:
    """Creates a support ticket from the provided issue description.

    Args:
        issue_description (str): The description of the customer's issue.

    Returns:
        str: The confirmation of the ticket creation.
    """
    ticket_id = f"TICKET-{random.randint(1000, 9999)}"
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()
    return json.dumps({"ticket_id": ticket_id, "created_at": timestamp, "description": issue_description})
```

### Product Info Provider Tool

#### Purpose and Business Value

Delivers detailed product information, aiding customers in making informed purchasing decisions.

#### Technical Implementation

```python
# product_info_provider.py
import json
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="product_info_provider", description="Provides product information", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def product_info_provider(product_id: str) -> str:
    """Retrieves information about a specific product.

    Args:
        product_id (str): The unique identifier for the product.

    Returns:
        str: The detailed information about the product.
    """
    products = {
        "001": {"name": "Printer Model X", "price": "299.99", "features": "Fast printing, Wireless"},
        "002": {"name": "Scanner Model Y", "price": "199.99", "features": "High resolution, Portable"}
    }
    return json.dumps(products.get(product_id, "Product not found."))
```

### Import Tools

Import the tools using the following CLI commands:

```bash
orchestrate tools import -k python -f faq_responder.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f order_status_checker.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f support_ticket_creator.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f product_info_provider.py
```

## Step 3: Import Tools and Agents

### Import Process

Importing the tools and agents is essential to deploy the solution within the IBM watsonx Orchestrate platform, ensuring all components are integrated and operational.

#### Agent Import Commands

```bash
orchestrate agents import -f master_template_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f customization_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f escalation_agent.yaml
```

## Verification

To verify the system's functionality, conduct the following tests using synthetic data:

1. **FAQ Response Testing**: Simulate FAQ queries and verify the tool provides correct responses.
2. **Order Status Simulation**: Test the Order Status Checker with different order IDs to ensure accurate status updates.
3. **Support Ticket Creation**: Create mock support tickets and confirm they are logged correctly.
4. **Product Information Retrieval**: Query various product IDs to verify the Product Info Provider returns accurate data.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Tool Import Errors**: Validate Python files for syntax accuracy and ensure correct file paths during import.
- **Agent Collaboration Issues**: Confirm all collaborator agents are properly defined in the YAML configurations.
- **Data Mismatch**: Ensure synthetic data is accurate and complete to prevent discrepancies.

## Best Practices

- **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive, clear names for agents and tools to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for agents and tools to assist with future updates and troubleshooting.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling in tools to manage unexpected inputs and scenarios.
- **Scalability**: Design agents and tools to be modular and scalable, allowing easy adaptation to new client requirements.
