# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: "Empower" Agent for Employee Success

## 1. Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building and deploying the "Empower" agent, a sophisticated digital assistant designed to streamline and automate key Human Resources (HR) and IT support processes for the client. The "Empower" agent acts as a central supervisor, intelligently routing employee requests to specialized collaborator agents for handling tasks related to healthcare, benefits, and ServiceNow IT support.

The primary business objective is to enhance the employee experience by providing a single, conversational interface for resolving common queries and tasks, thereby reducing the burden on HR and IT staff. This solution leverages the full power of the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) to create a multi-agent architecture. This architecture includes a supervisor agent (`empower_agent`), two specialized collaborator agents (`customer_care_agent` and `service_now_agent`), a set of custom Python tools for backend integration, and a knowledge base for answering frequently asked questions.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning the implementation, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Account**: An active watsonx Orchestrate account with access to the agent builder capabilities.
*   **Python Environment**: Python 3.9 or later installed on your development machine.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit must be installed. If not, install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
*   **Orchestrate CLI Login**: You must be logged into your watsonx Orchestrate environment via the CLI.
    ```bash
    orchestrate login
    ```
*   **Text Editor/IDE**: A code editor such as Visual Studio Code for creating and editing Python and YAML files.

## 3. Project Structure

To maintain a clean and organized project, create the following directory structure. This separation of concerns simplifies development, management, and deployment.

```

|   |-- service_now_agent.yaml

## 4. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

This section details the creation of all required assets, from backend tools to the final supervisor agent.

### Step 4.1: Create the Python Tools

First, we will create the Python-based tools that our agents will use to perform actions. These tools simulate interactions with backend systems like healthcare databases and ServiceNow, returning realistic synthetic data.

#### 4.1.1 Customer Care Tools

These tools handle healthcare and benefits-related inquiries.

**File: `/tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py`**

**Business Value**: This tool provides employees with immediate, on-demand access to their healthcare plan details. It eliminates the need to search through complex documents or contact HR for basic information, saving time for both the employee and the HR department. By providing clear, structured data on deductibles, co-pays, and coverage, it empowers employees to make informed healthcare decisions.

```python
# /tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py
import json
from enum import Enum
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Plan(str, Enum):
    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'
    PPO = 'PPO'

@tool
def get_healthcare_benefits(plan: Plan, in_network: bool = None):
    """Retrieves a comprehensive list of health benefits data, organized by coverage type and plan variant.

    This data includes details such as annual deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and various co-pays or
    percentages for medical services under different network plans (HDHP, HDHP Plus, and PPO).

    Args:
        plan (str): The plan the user is currently on. Can be one of "HDHP", "HDHP Plus", or "PPO".
        in_network (bool, optional): Whether the user wants coverage for in-network or out-of-network.
            If not provided, both will be returned.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries containing benefit details for the specified plan.
    """
    #
    # MOCK DATA: In a real scenario, this would call a healthcare provider's API.
