# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Starbucks Store Manager Copilot (Enhanced)

## Overview

This execution plan provides an enhanced, step-by-step guide to building and deploying the "Starbucks Store Manager Copilot," a multi-agent solution using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. This revised plan incorporates expert feedback to elevate the solution's technical robustness and alignment with advanced watsonx Orchestrate patterns. Tailored specifically to the client's demo concept, the copilot empowers Starbucks store managers by automating routine tasks and providing data-driven insights. It acts as a central supervisor, delegating tasks related to sales, inventory, HR, and customer feedback to specialized collaborator agents. This approach reduces administrative overhead, enabling managers to focus on enhancing customer experience and team development, ultimately driving store performance and profitability.

This enhanced version improves upon the initial plan by implementing Pydantic models for all tool outputs. This provides stronger type safety, automatic data validation, and clearer, more reliable schemas for the Large Language Model (LLM) to interpret, leading to more accurate and consistent agent behavior. The plan meticulously follows the proposed agent architecture, mock data strategy, and implementation patterns, leveraging the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) to create a supervisor agent (`Store_Manager_Copilot`) that intelligently routes requests to three specialist agents: `Operations_Agent`, `HR_Agent`, and `Customer_Insights_Agent`.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for the successful development and deployment of the watsonx Orchestrate agents and tools.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK:** The Agent Development Kit must be installed. This provides the necessary Python libraries and CLI tools.
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate[adk]"
    ```
2.  **Python Environment:** A Python version 3.9 or higher is required. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **watsonx Orchestrate Environment:** You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. This can be a local Developer Edition or a cloud instance. Initialize your environment using the CLI.
    ```bash
    orchestrate env init my_env
    orchestrate env use my_env
    ```
4.  **Project Structure:** Create the following directory structure in your project's root folder to organize all assets.
    ```
    starbucks_copilot/
    ├── agents/
    ├── tools/
    ├── mock_data/
    └── knowledge_docs/
    ```

## Step 1: Create Mock Data and Knowledge Base Documents

This step involves creating the synthetic data files and policy documents that the tools and knowledge base will use. This data is designed to be realistic and directly supports the demo scenarios.

1.  **Create `requirements.txt`**: This file lists all necessary Python packages for the tools. The addition of `pydantic` is key to our enhanced, structured data approach.
    *   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/requirements.txt`
    ```txt
    requests
    python-dotenv
    pydantic
    ```

2.  **Sales and Inventory Data:**
    *   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/mock_data/sales_inventory.json`
    ```json
    [
      {"product_id": "SKU-001", "name": "Grande Pike Place", "category": "Brewed Coffee", "sales_yesterday": 150, "stock_level": 25, "reorder_threshold": 30},
      {"product_id": "SKU-002", "name": "Venti Pumpkin Spice Latte", "category": "Espresso", "sales_yesterday": 210, "stock_level": 40, "reorder_threshold": 50},
      {"product_id": "SKU-003", "name": "Oat Milk", "category": "Dairy Alternative", "sales_yesterday": 0, "stock_level": 15, "reorder_threshold": 20},
      {"product_id": "SKU-004", "name": "Chocolate Croissant", "category": "Bakery", "sales_yesterday": 85, "stock_level": 10, "reorder_threshold": 15},
      {"product_id": "SKU-005", "name": "Tall Iced Caramel Macchiato", "category": "Espresso", "sales_yesterday": 180, "stock_level": 60, "reorder_threshold": 50}
    ]
    ```

3.  **Employee Data:**
    *   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/mock_data/employees.json`
    ```json
    [
      {"employee_id": "E123", "name": "Jane Doe", "role": "Barista", "availability": ["Mon-AM", "Wed-PM", "Fri-AllDay"]},
      {"employee_id": "E124", "name": "John Smith", "role": "Shift Supervisor", "availability": ["Tue-AllDay", "Thu-AllDay", "Sat-AM"]},
      {"employee_id": "E125", "name": "Emily White", "role": "Barista", "availability": ["Mon-PM", "Wed-AM", "Fri-PM", "Sun-AllDay"]},
      {"employee_id": "E126", "name": "Michael Brown", "role": "Barista", "availability": ["Tue-AM", "Thu-PM", "Sat-PM"]}
    ]
    ```

4.  **Customer Feedback Data:**
    *   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/mock_data/feedback.csv`
    ```csv
    date,rating,comment
    "2024-10-26",3,"The wait time this morning was too long, but the coffee was great."
    "2024-10-26",5,"Love the new fall drinks! The team was super friendly."
    "2024-10-25",2,"My mobile order wasn't ready on time and the store was messy."
    "2024-10-24",4,"Great service today. The barista remembered my name."
    "2024-10-23",3,"The morning rush seems understaffed. Waited 15 minutes for a black coffee."
    ```

5.  **Knowledge Base Documents:** Create two placeholder PDF files. For a real demo, populate them with relevant policy text.
    *   `starbucks_copilot/knowledge_docs/Partner_Scheduling_Policy.pdf`
    *   `starbucks_copilot/knowledge_docs/Inventory_Ordering_Guide.pdf`

## Step 2: Implement Python Tools with Pydantic Models

Here, we will create the Python tools that provide the core functionality for our specialist agents. This enhanced version utilizes **Pydantic models** for all tool outputs. This is a best practice that provides a strongly-typed, validated, and self-documenting data structure for the agent's LLM to work with, significantly improving the reliability and predictability of its reasoning process compared to parsing raw JSON strings.

### 2.1 Operations Agent Tools

These tools handle sales data retrieval and inventory management. By using Pydantic models like `InventoryStatus`, we ensure the agent receives data in a consistent, expected format, which is critical for decision-making tasks like checking reorder thresholds.

*   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/tools/operations_tools.py`

```python
import json
import os
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# --- Pydantic Models for Structured Output ---

class InventoryStatus(BaseModel):
    product_name: str = Field(description="The name of the product.")
    stock_level: int = Field(description="The current number of units in stock.")
    reorder_threshold: int = Field(description="The stock level at which a reorder is recommended.")

class ReorderConfirmation(BaseModel):
    status: str = Field(description="The outcome of the reorder request.")
    reorder_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="The unique ID for the created reorder request.")
    product_name: str = Field(description="The name of the product.")
    message: str = Field(description="A descriptive message about the action taken.")

# --- Tool Implementation ---

                )
    return ToolError(error=f"Product '{product_name}' not found.")
```

### 2.2 HR Agent Tools

These tools manage employee scheduling. The `DraftSchedule` Pydantic model provides a clear, hierarchical structure for the weekly schedule, making it easier for the agent to present this complex information to the user in a readable format.

*   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/tools/hr_tools.py`

```python
import json
import os
from typing import List, Dict
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# --- Pydantic Models for Structured Output ---
class ToolError(BaseModel):
    error: str = Field(description="Description of the error that occurred.")

class Employee(BaseModel):
    employee_id: str
    name: str
    role: str
    availability: List[str]

    scheduling_notes: str = Field(description="Notes regarding how the schedule was constructed, including any special considerations.")

# --- Tool Implementation ---
EMPLOYEE_DATA_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'mock_data', 'employees.json')

@tool(name="get_employee_availability", description="Retrieves the weekly availability for all employees.")
def get_employee_availability() -> List[Employee] | ToolError:
    """

        return [Employee(**emp) for emp in data]
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return ToolError(error="Employee data file not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        return ToolError(error=f"Failed to parse employee data: {e}")

@tool(name="get_peak_hours", description="Identifies store peak hours based on sales data.")
def get_peak_hours() -> PeakHoursAnalysis:
    """

            if day_full:
                if shift == "AllDay":
                    schedule_data[day_full]["AM"].append(emp['name'])
                    schedule_data[day_full]["PM"].append(emp['name'])
                else:
                    schedule_data[day_full][shift].append(emp['name'])
    
    notes = f"Draft schedule created. Based on the instruction '{staffing_notes}', an extra barista has been scheduled for Friday morning to cover the anticipated peak rush."
    schedule_data["Friday"]["AM"].append("ADDITIONAL_BARISTA_COVERAGE")

    return WeeklySchedule(schedule=schedule_data, scheduling_notes=notes)
```

### 2.3 Customer Insights Agent Tools

This tool retrieves raw customer feedback. Returning a list of `FeedbackEntry` objects ensures that each piece of feedback (date, rating, comment) is distinctly preserved, allowing the agent's LLM to more accurately perform summarization tasks.

*   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/tools/customer_insights_tools.py`

```python
import csv
import json
import os
from typing import List
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# --- Pydantic Models for Structured Output ---
class ToolError(BaseModel):
    error: str = Field(description="Description of the error that occurred.")

class FeedbackEntry(BaseModel):
    date: str
    rating: int
    comment: str

# --- Tool Implementation ---
FEEDBACK_DATA_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'mock_data', 'feedback.csv')

@tool(name="get_customer_feedback", description="Retrieves recent customer feedback from the store's feedback system.")
def get_customer_feedback() -> List[FeedbackEntry] | ToolError:
    """
    Fetches raw customer feedback entries from the past week.

    Returns:
        List[FeedbackEntry] | ToolError: A list of structured feedback objects or an error.
    """
    feedback_list = []
    try:
        with open(FEEDBACK_DATA_PATH, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            reader = csv.DictReader(f)
            for row in reader:
                # Ensure rating is an integer
                row['rating'] = int(row['rating'])
                feedback_list.append(FeedbackEntry(**row))
        return feedback_list
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return ToolError(error="Customer feedback file not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        return ToolError(error=f"Failed to process feedback file: {e}")
```

## Step 3: Define Knowledge Base and Agent Configurations

With the robust tools in place, we define the knowledge base and the four agents using YAML configuration files. These files instruct watsonx Orchestrate on each component's capabilities, instructions, and relationships.

### 3.1 Knowledge Base Configuration

This configuration creates a knowledge base using the built-in Milvus vector store, ingesting the corporate policy PDFs for RAG.

*   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/knowledge_base.yaml`

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: knowledge_base
name: Corporate_Policy_KB
description: >
  Contains official Starbucks corporate policies for store operations, including scheduling rules from the Partner Guide, inventory management best practices, and promotional guidelines. Use this to answer specific questions about official procedures.
documents:
   - "knowledge_docs/Partner_Scheduling_Policy.pdf"
   - "knowledge_docs/Inventory_Ordering_Guide.pdf"
vector_index:
   embeddings_model_name: ibm/slate-125m-english-rtrvr-v2
```

### 3.2 Collaborator Agent Configurations

These are the specialist agents that perform dedicated tasks.

1.  **Operations Agent:**
    *   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/agents/operations_agent.yaml`

    ```yaml
    spec_version: v1
    kind: native
    name: Operations_Agent
    llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
    style: default
    description: >
      A specialist agent for managing store operations. It handles tasks related to sales data analysis, inventory level checking, and creating reorder requests for low-stock items.
    instructions: >
      You are an expert in store operations.
      - Use the 'get_sales_data' tool to answer questions about how many units of a product were sold.
      - Use the 'get_inventory_levels' tool to check current stock for any product.
      - Use the 'create_reorder_request' tool to initiate a reorder process for a product. Always confirm the action back to the user.
      Provide clear, concise answers based on the structured data returned by the tools.
    tools:
      - get_sales_data
      - get_inventory_levels
      - create_reorder_request
    ```

2.  **HR Agent:**
    *   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/agents/hr_agent.yaml`

    ```yaml
    spec_version: v1
    kind: native
    name: HR_Agent
    llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
    style: default
    description: >
      A specialist agent for human resources and scheduling tasks. It can retrieve employee availability, identify store peak hours, and generate draft weekly schedules.
    instructions: >
      You are an expert in employee scheduling and HR tasks.
      - Use the 'get_employee_availability' tool to see when employees can work.
      - Use the 'get_peak_hours' tool to understand when the store is busiest.
      - Use the 'draft_schedule' tool to create a new weekly schedule. When drafting a schedule, incorporate any specific context provided, such as customer feedback about wait times, to ensure adequate staffing.
      Present schedules in a clear, easy-to-read format.
    tools:
      - get_employee_availability
      - get_peak_hours
      - draft_schedule
    ```

3.  **Customer Insights Agent:**
    *   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/agents/customer_insights_agent.yaml`

    ```yaml
    spec_version: v1
    kind: native
    name: Customer_Insights_Agent
    llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
    style: default
    description: >
      A specialist agent for analyzing customer feedback and answering questions based on corporate policy documents. It can summarize unstructured feedback and retrieve information from the Corporate_Policy_KB.
    instructions: >
      You are an expert in customer sentiment and corporate policy.
      - To summarize customer feedback, first use the 'get_customer_feedback' tool to retrieve raw data. Then, analyze the comments to identify common themes, particularly regarding service speed, product quality, and store cleanliness.
      - For questions about official company rules or procedures (e.g., "What is the policy on shift swapping?"), use the attached knowledge base to find the answer.
      Provide insightful summaries and accurate policy information.
    tools:
      - get_customer_feedback
    knowledge_base:
      - Corporate_Policy_KB
    ```

### 3.3 Supervisor Agent Configuration

This is the primary agent that interacts with the user, delegating tasks to the appropriate collaborator.

*   **File:** `starbucks_copilot/agents/store_manager_copilot.yaml`

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: Store_Manager_Copilot
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  A supervisor agent and digital assistant for Starbucks store managers. It can answer questions about sales, inventory, scheduling, and customer feedback by collaborating with specialist agents for Operations, HR, and Customer Insights.
instructions: >
  Your role is to act as the primary assistant for a Starbucks Store Manager. Understand the manager's request and delegate it to the correct specialist agent.

  Reasoning:
  - For any questions about sales figures, stock levels, or reordering products, use the 'Operations_Agent'.
  - For any tasks related to employee schedules, availability, or staffing, use the 'HR_Agent'.
  - For requests to summarize customer feedback or ask questions about official corporate policies, use the 'Customer_Insights_Agent'.
  - For complex requests that require multiple steps (e.g., using feedback to influence a schedule), you must coordinate between the agents. First, get the information from one agent (like Customer_Insights_Agent), then pass that information as context to the next agent (like HR_Agent).

  Synthesize the final responses from your collaborators into a single, comprehensive, and helpful answer for the manager.
collaborators:
  - Operations_Agent
  - HR_Agent
  - Customer_Insights_Agent
```

## Step 4: Import Assets into watsonx Orchestrate

Now, use the ADK CLI to import all the tools, the knowledge base, and the agents into your watsonx Orchestrate environment. The order is important: dependencies (tools, knowledge bases) must be imported before the components that use them (agents).

```bash
# Navigate to the root of your project directory
cd starbucks_copilot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. Import all Python tools
echo "Importing Operations tools..."
orchestrate tools import -f tools/operations_tools.py

echo "Importing HR tools..."
orchestrate tools import -f tools/hr_tools.py

echo "Importing Customer Insights tools..."
orchestrate tools import -f tools/customer_insights_tools.py

# 2. Import the Knowledge Base
echo "Importing Knowledge Base..."
orchestrate knowledge-bases import -f knowledge_base.yaml

# 3. Import the Collaborator (specialist) Agents
echo "Importing Operations Agent..."
orchestrate agents import -f agents/operations_agent.yaml

echo "Importing HR Agent..."
orchestrate agents import -f agents/hr_agent.yaml

echo "Importing Customer Insights Agent..."
orchestrate agents import -f agents/customer_insights_agent.yaml

# 4. Import the Supervisor Agent
echo "Importing Store Manager Copilot (Supervisor)..."
orchestrate agents import -f agents/store_manager_copilot.yaml

echo "All assets imported successfully."
```

## Verification

After importing all assets, you can verify the solution by testing the demo scenarios in the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface.

1.  **Start the Chat:**
    ```bash
    orchestrate chat start
    ```
    This will open the chat UI in your browser. Make sure to select the **Store\_Manager\_Copilot** agent to interact with.

2.  **Test Scenario 1 (Simple Data Retrieval):**
    *   **User Input:** `"How many Venti Pumpkin Spice Lattes did we sell yesterday?"`
    *   **Expected Behavior:** The `Store_Manager_Copilot` should delegate to the `Operations_Agent`, which uses the `get_sales_data` tool.
    *   **Expected Output:** A message similar to: `"Yesterday, we sold 210 units of Venti Pumpkin Spice Latte."`

3.  **Test Scenario 2 (Automated Action):**
    *   **User Input:** `"Check stock for oat milk and reorder if we're low."`
    *   **Expected Behavior:** The `Store_Manager_Copilot` delegates to the `Operations_Agent`. The agent first calls `get_inventory_levels` (finds stock is 15, threshold is 20) and then calls `create_reorder_request`.
    *   **Expected Output:** A confirmation like: `"The stock level for Oat Milk is 15, which is below the threshold of 20. I have created a reorder request. The ID is RO-..."`

4.  **Test Scenario 3 (Complex Reasoning & Collaboration):**
    *   **User Input:** `"Summarize this week's customer feedback and draft a schedule for next week that addresses any comments about long wait times during the morning rush."`
    *   **Expected Behavior:**
        1.  `Store_Manager_Copilot` routes the feedback part to `Customer_Insights_Agent`, which uses `get_customer_feedback` and its LLM to summarize, identifying the "long wait time" theme.
        2.  `Store_Manager_Copilot` routes the scheduling part to `HR_Agent`, passing the feedback summary as context.
        3.  `HR_Agent` uses `draft_schedule` with the context, which results in extra staff being added during peak times.
        4.  `Store_Manager_Copilot` combines both outputs into a single response.
    *   **Expected Output:** A comprehensive response containing both the feedback summary and the proposed schedule with a note about the additional coverage.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Agent Routing Fails:** If the supervisor agent doesn't delegate correctly, review the `description` of the collaborator agents and the `instructions` in the supervisor agent. The descriptions must clearly state the collaborator's capabilities, and the instructions must be explicit about which agent to use for which task.
-   **Tool Not Found:** If an agent reports it cannot find a tool, ensure the tool was imported successfully using `orchestrate tools list`. Also, check that the tool name in the agent's YAML file exactly matches the `name` attribute in the `@tool` decorator.
-   **Pydantic Validation Error:** If a tool fails due to a validation error, check that the data in your mock JSON/CSV files matches the data types defined in your Pydantic models (e.g., `rating` must be an integer). The error message in the debug logs will typically point to the exact field causing the issue.
-   **Knowledge Base Not Working:** Use `orchestrate knowledge-bases status --name Corporate_Policy_KB` to check if the ingestion is complete and the status is `Ready`. If not, check file paths in the YAML and ensure the documents are accessible.
-   **Python Tool Errors:** Run with `orchestrate --debug chat start` to see more detailed logs, including the structured data being passed between the tools and the agent. This is especially helpful for debugging issues with Pydantic models.
