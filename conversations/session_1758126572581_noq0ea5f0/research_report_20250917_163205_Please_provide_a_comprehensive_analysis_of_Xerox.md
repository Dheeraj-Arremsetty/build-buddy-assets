    *   **Competitive Pressure:** Intense competition from both traditional rivals and new digital-native companies puts pressure on pricing and margins.

### **3. Revenue Generation**

Xerox's income is primarily generated through two interconnected streams, with a strategic emphasis on growing the more stable, service-based portion.

1.  **Equipment Sales:** This is the traditional, transactional revenue from the outright sale of printers, MFDs, and other hardware. This stream is often a precursor to the more lucrative post-sale revenue.
2.  **Post-Sale Revenue:** This is the largest and most critical component of Xerox's income, accounting for the majority of its total revenue. It is largely recurring and includes:
    *   **Supplies:** Sales of toner, ink, and other consumables.
    *   **Service and Maintenance Contracts:** Recurring fees for equipment upkeep and technical support.
    *   **Financing:** Income from leasing equipment to customers.
    *   **Managed Services:** Contractual revenue from Managed Print Services (MPS) and IT Services.

The business model is designed to place hardware in a client's environment to generate a long-term, predictable stream of high-margin, post-sale revenue.

### **4. Offerings: Service-Based vs. Digital Products**

Xerox's portfolio is a blend of physical hardware, comprehensive services, and increasingly, standalone digital solutions.

**Service-Based Offerings:**

*   **Software:**
    *   **Xerox® DocuShare®:** An enterprise content management (ECM) platform for storing, managing, and sharing documents.
    *   **XMPie®:** A platform for creating personalized, data-driven marketing campaigns across print and digital channels.
    *   **CareAR™:** An augmented reality platform that provides remote visual assistance and guidance for service teams.

### **5. AI Strategy: The Xerox Agent Builder**

Xerox's AI strategy is a key pillar of its reinvention, aimed at embedding intelligence into its core offerings and creating new, high-value software revenue streams. The **Xerox® Agent Builder** is the flagship product of this strategy.

*   **Core Concept:** Agent Builder is a low-code/no-code platform that allows users without data science expertise to create and deploy AI-powered "agents."
