### **7. Competitor AI Innovation**

The competitive landscape is rapidly evolving as S&P Global's peers make significant investments in generative AI to enhance their own offerings.

*   **Bloomberg:** A formidable competitor, Bloomberg has made a major move with the development of **BloombergGPT**, a proprietary Large Language Model (LLM) specifically trained on decades of curated financial data from the Bloomberg Terminal.

While S&P Global's Kensho and vast datasets give it a strong foundation, competitors like Bloomberg are leveraging their own unique data ecosystems to build powerful, domain-specific AI.
