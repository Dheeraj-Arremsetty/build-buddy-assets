## **[SECTION 2: THE SMB CHALLENGE]**
*Duration: 2 minutes*

### **The Digital Document Paradox**
"Let me paint a familiar picture for your SMB customers:

**Current State Pain Points:**
- **Invoice Processing:** *"Sarah in Accounting receives 50+ PDF invoices daily via email. She manually downloads, categorizes, and routes each one for approval"*
- **Time Drain:** *"This takes 3-4 hours daily – that's 40% of her workday on repetitive tasks"*
- **Error Rate:** *"Manual processing leads to 5-10% error rate in routing and data entry"*
- **Delayed Approvals:** *"Documents sit in email inboxes for days waiting for action"*

### **The Hidden Costs**
"For a typical 50-person SMB:
- **15-20 hours weekly** spent on document routing
- **$50,000+ annually** in productivity losses
- **3-5 day average** document processing cycle
- **Customer satisfaction** impacted by slow response times"

### **Why Traditional Solutions Fail SMBs**
- "Enterprise workflow systems are too complex and expensive"
- "Point solutions don't integrate with existing tools"
- "Custom development requires IT resources SMBs don't have"

**Transition:** *"This is where watsonx Orchestrate changes the game..."*
