# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Automating Financial Risk & Compliance Reporting

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building and demonstrating a sophisticated IBM watsonx Orchestrate solution for a financial services client. The demo focuses on automating the complex, multi-stage process of quarterly risk and compliance reporting. This scenario is designed to showcase Orchestrate's core strengths in agent collaboration, tool orchestration, and integrating with enterprise-level workflows.

The solution will feature a multi-agent architecture where a supervisor agent orchestrates a team of specialized collaborator agents to perform data aggregation, compliance validation, and report generation. This approach mirrors real-world business processes, demonstrating how Orchestrate can break down complex tasks into manageable, automated steps, thereby reducing manual effort, minimizing errors, and accelerating time-to-insight for the client's risk management teams.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for successfully building, importing, and running the agents and tools defined in this plan.

1.  **Python and pip**: Ensure Python (version 3.10 or later) and its package manager, `pip`, are installed on your system.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is the primary tool for this implementation. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **Orchestrate Environment**: You must have a configured IBM watsonx Orchestrate environment (either cloud or local developer edition). Initialize and activate your environment using the CLI:
    ```bash
    # Configure your environment (run once)
    orchestrate env add

    # Activate your environment for the current session
    orchestrate env use <your_environment_name>
    ```
4.  **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated directory to organize all the files for this demo. A structured layout is essential for managing agents, tools, and dependencies.
    ```bash
    mkdir finsecure_demo
    cd finsecure_demo
    mkdir agents
    mkdir tools
    ```

## Step 1: Create Project Dependencies

To ensure the Python-based tools have access to necessary libraries, we will define them in a `requirements.txt` file. This file lists all external packages that our tools depend on.

### Business Value
Defining dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file is a standard best practice that ensures reproducibility and simplifies deployment. It guarantees that the tools will run consistently across different environments by installing the exact libraries they were developed with.

### `requirements.txt` File
Create the following file in the root of your `finsecure_demo` directory. For this demo, we will use the `requests` library to simulate API calls and `python-dotenv` for managing environment variables, which is a good practice for future extensions.

**File:** `finsecure_demo/requirements.txt`
```text
requests
python-dotenv
```

Install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Create Python Tools

The tools are the functional building blocks of our agents, performing specific actions like data retrieval, analysis, and formatting. We will create three sets of tools, each in its own Python file, corresponding to the specialized agents that will use them.

### Tool Set 1: Data Aggregation Tools

These tools are responsible for gathering raw data from various simulated enterprise sources. They generate realistic, synthetic data that mimics what would be pulled from transaction databases, market data APIs, and internal audit systems.

**File:** `finsecure_demo/tools/data_aggregation_tools.py`

```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
