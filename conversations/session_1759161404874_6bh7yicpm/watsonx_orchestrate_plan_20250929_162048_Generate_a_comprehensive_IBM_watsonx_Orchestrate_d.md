## Execution Plan

# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: "FinSecure Capital" Compliance Automation

## 1. Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building a watsonx Orchestrate demonstration tailored for **FinSecure Capital**, a financial services client. The demo addresses a critical business challenge: the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of pre-trade compliance checking. The proposed solution is a sophisticated multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end workflow, from data gathering to final reporting.

The system is architected around a central **Supervisor Agent (`ComplianceOrchestrator`)** that intelligently delegates tasks to a team of specialized **Collaborator Agents**. These collaborators handle specific functions: data harvesting (`DataHarvesterAgent`), rule validation (`ComplianceRulesAgent`), risk analysis (`RiskAnalysisAgent`), and report generation (`ReportingAgent`). This modular architecture demonstrates how watsonx Orchestrate can orchestrate complex, multi-step business processes, significantly reducing manual effort, minimizing compliance risks, and accelerating trade execution cycles. This plan includes all necessary code, configuration files, and commands to build and deploy this powerful automation solution.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for the successful development, import, and execution of the agents and tools defined in this plan.

*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Account**: An active SaaS or Developer Edition environment. This plan assumes the use of the watsonx Orchestrate ADK connected to an environment.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed and configured. If not installed, run:
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate[adk]"
    ```
*   **Python**: Python version 3.9 or higher is required.
*   **Environment Initialization**: Your ADK must be configured to point to your watsonx Orchestrate environment. If you haven't done so, run the `orchestrate env init` command and follow the prompts.
*   **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated directory structure to organize your files. This promotes maintainability and clarity.
    ```bash
    mkdir finsecure_demo
    cd finsecure_demo
    mkdir agents
    mkdir tools
    ```

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create Python Tools

The foundation of our agent capabilities lies in a set of well-defined Python tools. Each tool performs a discrete task, such as fetching data or executing a business rule. We will create four separate Python files, one for each functional area, and place them in the `tools/` directory.

#### 3.1. Data Harvester Tools (`data_harvester_tools.py`)

**Business Value**: These tools automate the critical first step of any compliance check: data aggregation. By automatically fetching real-time market data, client portfolio specifics, and instrument details, the `DataHarvesterAgent` eliminates the manual, error-prone process of analysts gathering information from disparate systems. This ensures the compliance check is always based on accurate, up-to-the-minute information, improving decision quality and speed.

**Technical Implementation**: The tools simulate API calls to various financial data systems. They generate realistic, synthetic data structures representing market prices, portfolio holdings, and security details. Each function is decorated with `@tool` and includes a detailed docstring that watsonx Orchestrate uses to understand its purpose, arguments, and return values.

Create the file `tools/data_harvester_tools.py`:
```python
# tools/data_harvester_tools.py
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="fetch_market_data", description="Fetches the latest market price and volume for a given stock ticker.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_market_data(ticker: str) -> str:
    """

        ticker (str): The stock ticker symbol to fetch data for (e.g., 'IBM', 'GOOGL').

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing the market data for the requested ticker.

#### 3.2. Compliance Rules Tools (`compliance_rules_tools.py`)

**Business Value**: These tools form the core of the compliance engine, automating the validation of trades against complex, multi-faceted rule sets. By codifying regulatory limits, client-specific investment mandates (like ESG or ethical restrictions), and internal policies, these tools replace manual checklist reviews. This dramatically reduces the risk of human error, ensures 100% auditability of every compliance decision, and guarantees that all investment activities are aligned with legal
