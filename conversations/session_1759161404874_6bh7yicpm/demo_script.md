### **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: FinSecure Capital**
**Use Case:** Intelligent Client Inquiry Triage
**Total Time:** 18 Minutes

### **Section 1: Opening & The Business Challenge (3 minutes)**

**Presenter:** Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with IBM watsonx.

Today, we're going to talk about a challenge that's universal but has unique pressures in the financial services industry: client support. At FinSecure Capital, your reputation is built on providing timely, accurate, and expert guidance. Your clients expect nothing less.

**[TALKING POINTS]**

*   **The High-Stakes Environment:** In your world, a slow or incorrect answer isn't just an inconvenience; it can impact investment decisions, client trust, and your bottom line.
*   **The "Swivel Chair" Problem:** Think about your client support agents today. When a complex inquiry comes in, what's their workflow?
    *   They might first search a knowledge base or SharePoint site for an answer.
    *   If they can't find it, they have to read the query, interpret its intent, and decide which expert team—Market Intelligence, Ratings Methodology, a specific analyst—is the right one to handle it.
    *   Then, they switch to your internal service desk system, manually create a ticket, copy-paste the client's message, add their own summary, and route it.
*   **The Hidden Costs:** This manual process, this "swivel chair" workflow, is incredibly inefficient. It leads to:
    *   **Slow Response Times:** Every manual handoff adds delay, frustrating clients.
    *   **Inconsistent Triage:** A newer agent might route a query differently than a senior one, leading to tickets bouncing between departments.
    *   **High Operational Overhead:** You're paying highly skilled agents to be administrative coordinators, not problem-solvers.
    *   **Lost Knowledge:** The context and nuance of a query can be lost in the copy-paste shuffle.

What if you could empower every agent with a digital teammate that instantly knows the right answer, or if not, instantly knows who *would* know the right answer and how to get it to them?

### **Section 2: The Solution - An AI-Powered Digital Teammate (3 minutes)**

**Presenter:** That's exactly what we've built with IBM watsonx Orchestrate. We're not just automating tasks; we're orchestrating complex work by giving your team an AI-powered assistant that acts as a central nervous system for client inquiries.

**[SHOW A SLIDE WITH A SIMPLE DIAGRAM: Client Query -> FinSecure Support Assistant -> (Path 1: Knowledge Base Answer) OR (Path 2: Triage & Ticket Creation)]**

**[VALUE PROPOSITION]**

*   **For the Client Support Agent:** We're giving them a single interface to resolve inquiries. They simply ask a question in natural language, and the assistant does the heavy lifting. This transforms their role from a router to a true client relationship manager.
*   **For the Business:** We are creating a scalable, consistent, and auditable process that drives massive efficiency. This means:
    *   **Faster Time-to-Resolution:** Drastically cutting down the time it takes to get clients the expert answers they need.
    *   **Increased Productivity:** Automating the 80% of routine work so your agents can focus on the 20% of high-value, complex interactions.
    *   **Improved Client Satisfaction (CSAT):** Quick, accurate answers build trust and loyalty.

This assistant is powered by a set of agents built with the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK). We have a **Supervisor Agent** that understands the initial request and delegates to specialized **Collaborator Agents**—one that's an expert in your knowledge base and another that's an expert in your service desk system.

Let's see it in action.

### **Section 3: Live Demo Flow (8 minutes)**

**Presenter:** `[SWITCH TO DEMO SCREEN - A SIMPLE CHAT INTERFACE]`

Alright, I'm now playing the role of a Client Support Agent at FinSecure. I have the "FinSecure Support Assistant" ready to help me. I've just received two different inquiries from clients.

#### **Scenario 1: Instant FAQ Resolution (The Simple Question)**

**Presenter:** The first query is a common one about your data subscription tiers. Instead of looking this up myself, I'll just ask the assistant.

`[PRESENTER TYPES INTO CHAT]`
> **"What are the subscription tiers and features for the Market Intelligence platform?"**

**Presenter:** Now, watch what happens. The assistant is accessing a knowledge base we've connected—this could be your internal documentation, PDFs, or a SharePoint site.

`[ASSISTANT RESPONDS QUICKLY WITH A FORMATTED TABLE OR BULLETED LIST]`
> **Expected Outcome:**
> *   **Tier 1: Professional** - Real-time market data, basic analytics.
> *   **Tier 2: Enterprise** - All Professional features plus advanced risk modeling and API access.
> *   **Tier 3: Institutional** - All Enterprise features plus dedicated analyst support and custom methodology reports.
> *Source: FinSecure Product Guide v3.2*

**Presenter:** Perfect. In seconds, I have a clear, accurate, and source-cited answer to send back to the client. No searching, no ambiguity. That's a 5-minute task reduced to 5 seconds.

#### **Scenario 2: Intelligent Triage & Automated Routing (The Complex Question)**

**Presenter:** Now for a more complex inquiry. This one requires true expertise.

`[PRESENTER TYPES INTO CHAT]`
> **"A client is reporting a discrepancy in the risk rating for Argentine sovereign bonds in their latest data feed. They say it doesn't align with the methodology described in our Q2 whitepaper. Can you help?"**

**Presenter:** This is not a simple FAQ. The assistant will first check the knowledge base and won't find a direct answer. This is where the real orchestration begins. It's now analyzing the language of the request.

`[ASSISTANT PROVIDES A RESPONSE SHOWCASING ITS REASONING]`
> **Expected Outcome:**
> "I understand. This query requires expert analysis as it relates to a potential data discrepancy and our ratings methodology.
>
> **Analysis:**
> *   **Keywords Identified:** 'discrepancy', 'risk rating', 'methodology', 'sovereign bonds'
> *   **Recommended Department:** Ratings Methodology Group
>
> I will create a high-priority ticket in our service desk system and assign it to the 'Ratings Methodology Group' queue. Would you like to proceed?"

**Presenter:** Look at that. It understood the nuance. It didn't just see "data feed" and send it to the data team; it saw "methodology" and "risk rating" and correctly identified the specialized group needed. It's even summarized the request for me. I'll confirm.

`[PRESENTER TYPES]`
> **"Yes, please proceed."**

`[ASSISTANT RESPONDS WITH CONFIRMATION]`
> **Expected Outcome:**
> "Ticket **T-2025-8675** has been successfully created and assigned to the **Ratings Methodology Group**.
>
> **Summary included in ticket:** 'Client reports risk rating discrepancy for Argentine sovereign bonds, citing a conflict with Q2 methodology whitepaper. Expert review of rating application is required.'
>
> The client-facing support team will be notified upon resolution."

**Presenter:** And just like that, the entire triage and routing process is complete. The right experts have been engaged with all the necessary context, and there's a fully auditable trail in our system of record. What used to be a 15-minute, multi-step process filled with potential for error is now done in under a minute, with precision.

### **Section 4: Technical Highlights & How It Works (2 minutes)**

**Presenter:** `[SWITCH BACK TO SLIDES]`

So what you just saw wasn't magic; it was a carefully orchestrated collaboration between AI agents.

*   **Supervisor Agent (`ClientInquirySupervisor`):** This is the "brains" of the operation. It receives the user's request and, using its instructions and an LLM, decides the best course of action.
*   **Knowledge Agent:** This collaborator has one job: query the knowledge base. It uses a tool we built called `search_product_docs` that connects to your document repository.
*   **Service Desk Agent:** This collaborator is an expert in your ticketing system. It uses a tool called `create_and_route_ticket` that connects via API to your service desk.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK:** We define these agents, their instructions, and their tools using the Agent Development Kit. It's a simple, declarative approach using YAML files and Python for the tools, making it incredibly fast to build, test, and deploy these digital workers. This modular design means we can easily add new capabilities—like an agent that can check client subscription status in Salesforce—without rebuilding the entire system.

### **Section 5: Q&A Preparation and Next Steps (2 minutes)**

**Presenter:** The business impact is clear: you're accelerating client support, reducing costs, and empowering your team to deliver exceptional service. Before we move to your questions, let's anticipate a few common ones.

**[PREPARED Q&A SLIDE]**

*   **Q1: How does this connect to our proprietary, in-house systems?**
    *   **A:** The ADK is incredibly flexible. We create custom Python tools that use your existing APIs or database connectors. If you have an OpenAPI specification for your service, it's even faster. We securely connect to your systems, we don't replace them.

*   **Q2: How much effort is it to set up and maintain the knowledge base?**
    *   **A:** Orchestrate can connect to existing knowledge sources. For document-based knowledge, you simply point it to your files (PDFs, DOCX, etc.). The system handles the ingestion and indexing. Maintenance is as simple as keeping your source documents up to date.

*   **Q3: Is our client's sensitive data secure?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely. IBM's commitment to data privacy and security is paramount. watsonx is built on a foundation of trust and transparency. Your data is your data, and it is not used to train foundational models. We can deploy this within your secure environment to meet FinSecure's specific compliance needs.

**[CALL TO ACTION]**

**Presenter:** What we've shown you today is a powerful example of how AI can orchestrate real work. The value here is compounding—the more processes you connect, the more intelligent and valuable the system becomes.

Our recommended next step is a **2-hour Discovery Workshop** with your client support and IT leadership. In that session, we'll map out your highest-priority inquiry types and design a tailored proof-of-concept for FinSecure Capital.

Thank you for your time. I'll now open it up for your questions.
