# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: "Empower" Agent for Employee Success

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building and deploying a sophisticated, multi-agent solution in IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The plan is centered around the **"Empower" agent**, a powerful digital assistant designed to streamline employee support for a large enterprise client. This agent acts as a central supervisor, intelligently routing employee inquiries to specialized collaborator agents for handling HR/benefits questions (`customer_care_agent`) and IT support issues (`service_now_agent`).

The "Empower" agent leverages a multi-layered architecture to provide a seamless user experience. It uses a knowledge base for answering common FAQ-style questions and collaborates with other agents that are equipped with specialized tools to interact with backend systems (like ServiceNow and healthcare plan databases). This demonstration will showcase watsonx Orchestrate's ability to automate complex business processes, reduce the burden on human support teams, and provide employees with instant, accurate, and contextual assistance.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the implementation, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK Installed**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed and configured. Refer to the official documentation for [Installing the watsonx Orchestrate ADK](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/getting_started/installing).
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
2.  **Active Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment (either cloud or local Developer Edition). Activate your environment using the CLI.
    ```bash
    orchestrate env activate <your_env_name>
    ```
3.  **Python 3.8+**: A compatible version of Python is required to create the custom tools.
4.  **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated directory to organize all your files for this demo.
    ```bash
    mkdir empower-demo
    cd empower-demo
    mkdir agents tools knowledge_base
    ```
5.  **Required Python Libraries**: Create a `requirements.txt` file in your root `empower-demo` directory. The tools will use the `requests` library for simulated API calls.
    ```text
    # requirements.txt
    requests
    ```
    Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Step 1: Create the Tools

Tools are the foundational components that allow agents to perform actions. We will create two sets of Python-based tools: one for customer care (healthcare/benefits) and one for IT support (ServiceNow).

### 1.1 Customer Care Tools

These tools, as detailed in the reference material, simulate interactions with a healthcare benefits system.

#### **File: `tools/customer_care_tools.py`**

This file will contain all three customer care tools for simplicity.

**Business Value**: These tools automate the retrieval of complex benefits, claims, and provider information, empowering employees to self-serve their healthcare inquiries 24/7. This reduces calls to the HR department and improves employee satisfaction by providing immediate answers.

```python
# tools/customer_care_tools.py

import requests
from enum import Enum
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

# --- Tool 1: get_healthcare_benefits ---

    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'

    percentages for medical services under different network plans (HDHP, HDHP Plus, and PPO).

    Args:
        plan (str, optional): The plan the user is currently on. Can be one of "HDHP", "HDHP Plus", or "PPO".

        return resp.json()['benefits']

        return {"error": "Failed to retrieve healthcare benefits.", "details": str(e)}

    """
    # This is a mock implementation providing synthetic data for a realistic demo.
