# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Financial Compliance & Risk Analysis Automation

## Overview
This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for creating a powerful watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for a client in the **Financial Services** domain. The demo showcases a multi-agent system designed to automate the complex workflow of financial compliance monitoring and risk analysis. A top-level **Compliance Supervisor Agent** orchestrates tasks by collaborating with specialized agents for data ingestion, risk analysis, and reporting. This solution addresses critical business needs such as reducing manual effort in compliance checks, improving the accuracy of risk detection, ensuring auditability, and accelerating response times to potential regulatory breaches.

The plan leverages the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) to build a robust, scalable, and adaptable digital labor solution. We will create custom Python-based tools that generate realistic synthetic financial data, and define native agents with detailed instructions and reasoning logic. By following this plan, the client will see a tangible demonstration of how watsonx Orchestrate can transform their core compliance operations, moving from reactive, manual processes to proactive, AI-driven automation.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure your development environment is set up with the following components. This setup is essential for creating, importing, and testing the agents and tools defined in this plan.

1.  **Python and pip**: IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK is a Python library. You must have Python (version 3.10 or higher) and its package manager, `pip`, installed.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The core development kit must be installed. If you haven't installed it, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-adk
    ```
3.  **Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. This could be a cloud instance or the local Developer Edition. Ensure you have initialized your environment using the CLI:
    ```bash
    orchestrate environment init
    ```
4.  **Text Editor/IDE**: A code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for creating and editing the Python (`.py`) and YAML (`.yaml`) files.

## Step 1: Project Setup
First, we'll create a structured directory for our project. This organization helps in managing agents, tools, and dependencies cleanly.

1.  Create a main project folder named `financial_compliance_demo`.
2.  Inside `financial_compliance_demo`, create two subdirectories: `agents` and `tools`.

Your project structure should look like this:

```
financial_compliance_demo/
├── agents/
└── tools/
```

## Step 2: Create Python Tools
The tools are the foundational components that perform specific actions. We will create three sets of tools: for data ingestion, risk analysis, and reporting. Each tool will generate realistic synthetic data to simulate interactions with real financial systems.

### 2.1 Data Ingestion Tools

These tools are responsible for gathering the raw data needed for the compliance workflow. They simulate fetching data from internal transaction databases and external market data providers.

**Business Value**: Automating data collection eliminates manual, error-prone data entry and ensures that the analysis is always based on the most current information available. This is the first critical step in creating a reliable and timely compliance process.

Create a file named `tools/data_ingestion_tools.py` and add the following code:

```python
# tools/data_ingestion_tools.py
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_market_data(market_sector: str, date_range: int = 7) -> str:
    """
    Fetches synthetic market trend data for a specified sector over a given date range.
    This tool simulates connecting to a market data API to gather context for financial analysis.

    Args:
        market_sector (str): The financial market sector to fetch data for (e.g., 'Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Energy').
        date_range (int): The number of past days to fetch data for. Defaults to 7.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing a list of daily market data points, including dates, sentiment scores, and key news headlines.
    """
    market_data = []
    sentiments = ['positive', 'negative', 'neutral']
    headlines = {
        'Technology': ["New AI Chip Unveiled", "Cloud Division Exceeds Expectations", "Regulatory Scrutiny on Big Tech Increases"],
        'Healthcare': ["Promising Drug Trial Results", "Healthcare Merger Approved", "New Telemedicine Platform Launched"],
        'Energy': ["Oil Prices Surge on Supply Concerns", "Major Investment in Renewable Energy", "Geopolitical Tensions Affect Market"]
    }

    for i in range(date_range):
        day = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=i)
        data_point = {
            "date": day.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            "sector": market_sector,
            "market_sentiment": random.choice(sentiments),
            "sentiment_score": round(random.uniform(0.3, 0.9), 2),
            "key_headline": random.choice(headlines.get(market_sector, ["General market news."]))
        }
        market_data.append(data_point)

    return json.dumps({"status": "success", "data": market_data})

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_transaction_logs(account_id: str, start_date: str, end_date: str) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves synthetic transaction logs for a specific account within a given date range.
    This simulates querying an internal banking or trading system for customer activity.

    Args:
        account_id (str): The unique identifier for the account being queried.
        start_date (str): The start date for the query in YYYY-MM-DD format.
        end_date (str): The end date for the query in YYYY-MM-DD format.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing a list of transaction records.
    """
    transactions = []
    statuses = ['completed', 'pending', 'flagged_for_review']
    transaction_types = ['deposit', 'withdrawal', 'transfer', 'securities_purchase']
    counterparties = ['Global Corp', 'Innovate Inc.', 'Quantum Solutions', 'Apex Holdings']

    start = datetime.strptime(start_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
    end = datetime.strptime(end_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
    num_transactions = random.randint(5, 20)

    for _ in range(num_transactions):
        tx_date = start + timedelta(seconds=random.randint(0, int((end - start).total_seconds())))
        transaction = {
            "transaction_id": f"TXN-{random.randint(1000000, 9999999)}",
            "account_id": account_id,
            "timestamp": tx_date.isoformat(),
            "amount": round(random.uniform(100.0, 50000.0), 2),
            "currency": "USD",
            "transaction_type": random.choice(transaction_types),
            "status": random.choice(statuses),
            "counterparty": random.choice(counterparties),
            "location": "USA"
        }
        transactions.append(transaction)

    return json.dumps({"status": "success", "data": transactions})
```

### 2.2 Risk Analysis Tools

These tools perform the core logic of the workflow, processing the ingested data to identify potential compliance issues and calculate risk scores.

**Business Value**: These automated analysis tools provide consistent, unbiased evaluation of financial activities. They can detect subtle patterns of anomalous behavior that a human analyst might miss, significantly improving the effectiveness of risk management and fraud detection programs.

Create a file named `tools/risk_analysis_tools.py` and add the following code:

```python
# tools/risk_analysis_tools.py
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def calculate_risk_score(transactions_json: str) -> str:
    """
    Calculates a risk score for a set of transactions based on predefined rules.
    Rules include transaction amount, frequency, and type.

    Args:
        transactions_json (str): A JSON string containing a list of transaction dictionaries.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string with an overall risk score and a breakdown of risk factors for each transaction.
    """
    try:
        transactions = json.loads(transactions_json)
        if not isinstance(transactions, list):
            transactions = transactions.get('data', [])
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": "Invalid JSON input."})

    scored_transactions = []
    overall_risk_points = 0
    
    for tx in transactions:
        points
