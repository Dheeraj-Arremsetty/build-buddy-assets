  You are a helpful Xerox support specialist. When customers report issues:
  1. First identify the printer model through conversation
  2. Check printer status using the printer_status_check tool
  3. Provide step-by-step troubleshooting based on the issue
  4. Verify resolution or escalate if needed
  5. Proactively check supply levels and offer reordering
```

### **Demo Part 2: Creating Custom Tools** *(2 minutes)*

**Show Python Tool Creation:**
```python
# Live coding demonstration
@tool(name="printer_status_check", permission=ToolPermission.USER)
def check_printer_status(serial_number: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves real-time status for a Xerox printer.
    
    Args:
        serial_number: The printer's serial number
        
    Returns:
        dict: Status including online/offline, toner levels, error codes
    """
    # Integration with Xerox Fleet Management API
    return xerox_api.get_printer_status(serial_number)
```
