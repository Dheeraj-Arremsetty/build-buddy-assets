### **Section 1: Introduction & Business Context (0:00 - 2:00)**

**(Timing: 2 minutes)**

**[SCREEN: Title Slide - "Empowering the Partner Experience at Starbucks with IBM watsonx Orchestrate" with IBM and Starbucks logos]**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Good morning. Thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with IBM watsonx Orchestrate."
*   "We've been following Starbucks' journey closely and are consistently impressed by your market leadership and your commitment to innovation, particularly with initiatives like 'Deep Brew.' Your focus on using technology to enhance both the customer and partner experience is what sets you apart."
*   "We also understand the challenges that come with that scale. The research we reviewed highlights pressures from rising operational costs and a complex labor environment. We know that supporting over 38,000 stores and hundreds of thousands of partners is a monumental task."
*   "Today, we're going to focus on that partner experience. We believe that empowering your partners with seamless, instant support is not just an HR function—it's a strategic imperative that directly impacts your brand and bottom line. We're here to show you a new way to achieve that at scale."

**Key Message:** We understand your business, your successes, and your challenges. We're here to show you a targeted solution that aligns with your strategic goals.

### **Section 2: The Challenge: The Fragmented Support Journey (2:00 - 4:00)**

**(Timing: 2 minutes)**

**[SCREEN: Slide with a diagram showing a confused employee surrounded by icons for different systems - HR Portal, Payroll System, Benefits Website, Phone Support]**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Let's consider the current support journey for a typical Starbucks partner—let's call her Maria, a barista at one of your busy cafes."
*   "Maria has a few simple but important questions:
    *   *How many sick days do I have left?*
    *   *Does my health plan cover physical therapy?*
    *   *I think my last paycheck was short. Who do I talk to?*"
*   "Right now, where does she go? She might have to search an internal portal for the sick day policy, log into a separate, third-party benefits website to check coverage, and then find the right number to call or form to fill out for the payroll issue. This is a fragmented, time-consuming, and often frustrating experience."
*   "This fragmentation has a real business cost:
    *   **High Cost-to-Serve:** Your HR and support teams spend a significant amount of time answering repetitive, low-level questions.
    *   **Lost Productivity:** Maria is spending time navigating systems instead of focusing on customers.
    *   **Reduced Partner Satisfaction:** A poor internal support experience can lead to frustration and disengagement, which is a critical concern in today's labor market."

**Key Message:** The current way of providing employee support is inefficient, costly, and creates a poor experience. There is a clear opportunity for improvement.

### **Section 3: The Solution: A Unified Digital Teammate (4:00 - 5:30)**

**(Timing: 1.5 minutes)**

**[SCREEN: Slide showing a single chat interface on a mobile phone with the title "Introducing the `Partner_Support_Agent`" and three value props: 1. Instant, 24/7 Answers 2. Automated Action-Taking 3. Seamless System Integration]**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Imagine if Maria had a single place to go for all her questions. A 24/7 digital assistant that not only provides answers but takes action on her behalf. That's what we've built using IBM watsonx Orchestrate: the `Partner_Support_Agent`."
*   "This isn't just another chatbot. A chatbot can find an answer in a document. An Orchestrate agent can **do things**. It can connect to your benefits system, integrate with your ticketing platform, and orchestrate complex workflows across multiple applications."
*   "It acts as a digital teammate for your partners and a force multiplier for your HR team. It handles the routine, so your people can handle the exceptions and the high-value, human-centric work."
*   "Let's see it in action. I'm going to take you through those three questions Maria had and show you how the `Partner_Support_Agent` handles each one."

**Key Message:** watsonx Orchestrate provides a single, intelligent interface that moves beyond simple Q&A to automate tasks and orchestrate complex workflows.

### **Section 4: Live Demo: A Day in the Life with the `Partner_Support_Agent` (5:30 - 12:30)**

**(Timing: 7 minutes)**

**[SCREEN: Live demo environment showing the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface]**

**Presenter Note:** Have the chat interface open and ready. Speak as if you are the partner, Maria, interacting with the agent.

**Demo Flow - Scenario 1: Simple Knowledge Retrieval**

*   **Presenter:** "Okay, I'm logged in as Maria. My first question is about my sick day policy. It's a common question that probably floods your HR inbox."
*   **Action:** Type into the chat: `How many sick days do I get per year?`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds almost instantly with a clear, concise answer pulled from a knowledge base.
    > **Agent Response:** "As a full-time partner at Starbucks, you are entitled to 5 paid sick days per calendar year. You can view your current balance in the partner portal."
*   **Talking Points:** "Simple, fast, and accurate. The agent searched a dedicated knowledge base of HR policy documents to find the answer in seconds. That's one less email or call for your HR team to handle."

**Demo Flow - Scenario 2: Complex Action & Agent Collaboration**

*   **Presenter:** "Now for a more complex question. I need to know if my health plan covers a specific service. This usually means digging through a complex benefits PDF or logging into another website."
*   **Action:** Type into the chat: `I need to see the benefits for physical therapy under the PPO plan.`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent processes for a moment, then returns a neatly formatted markdown table showing the specific coverage details.
    > **Agent Response:** "Of course. Here are the details for Physical Therapy under the PPO plan:"
    > | Coverage | PPO (In-Network) | PPO (Out-of-Network) |
    > | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    > | Physical Therapy | 90% covered after deductible | 70% covered after deductible |
    > | Annual Deductible | $1,000 (Individual) | $2,000 (Individual) |
*   **Talking Points:** "This is where the magic happens. This wasn't just a document search. The `Partner_Support_Agent` recognized this was a benefits question and **delegated the task to a specialized collaborator agent**—the `customer_care_agent`. That specialist agent then used a tool to call a benefits API, get the live data, and format it into this easy-to-read table. This is true orchestration."

**Demo Flow - Scenario 3: Orchestration with System Integration**

*   **Presenter:** "Finally, the most complex issue: a potential payroll error. This requires human intervention, but the agent can still start the process and ensure it gets to the right place."
*   **Action:** Type into the chat: `I think my last paycheck was incorrect, can you help me file a ticket?`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds conversationally, confirms the action, and reports back with a ticket number.
    > **Agent Response:** "I'm sorry to hear that. I can definitely open a support incident with the payroll team for you. I've created a ticket to have someone investigate this. Your incident number is INC0010345. A payroll specialist will contact you within 24 hours."
*   **Talking Points:** "Look at what happened here. The agent understood the request couldn't be fully automated. It invoked another collaborator, the `service_now_agent`, which used its tools to securely connect to your HR service management system—in this case, ServiceNow—and create a ticket with all the necessary context. Maria didn't have to fill out a form or find the right email address. The agent handled the entire workflow, ensuring a fast and trackable resolution."

### **Section 5: How It Works: The Builder Experience (12:30 - 15:30)**

**(Timing: 3 minutes)**

**[SCREEN: Slide with three columns: 1. "Define Agents in YAML", 2. "Build Tools in Python", 3. "Compose & Collaborate"]**

**Presenter Note:** Briefly show snippets of the YAML and Python code from the provided technical context to make it tangible.

**Talking Points:**

*   "So, how did we build this powerful agent so quickly? That's the beauty of the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit, or ADK. It's designed for your developers and builders."
*   **1. Define Agents in YAML:**
    *   **[Show snippet of `empower_agent.yaml`]**
    *   "First, we define our agents in a simple, human-readable format called YAML. Here, we give the agent its name, its core instructions, and most importantly, we tell it which other agents it can **collaborate** with, like the `customer_care_agent` and `service_now_agent`."
*   **2. Build Tools in Python:**
    *   **[Show snippet of `get_healthcare_benefits.py`]**
    *   "Next, we give the agents skills by creating tools. These are just Python functions. If your team can write a Python function to call an API, they can build a tool for Orchestrate. We use a simple `@tool` decorator, and the platform handles the rest. This makes it incredibly easy to connect to your existing systems, whether they're modern APIs or legacy applications."
*   **3. Compose & Collaborate:**
    *   "The real power comes from composing these building blocks. Our main `Partner_Support_Agent` acts as a supervisor. It listens to the user's request and intelligently routes the work to the correct specialist agent with the right tools. This mirrors how your own expert teams work and allows you to build incredibly sophisticated, scalable solutions without monolithic code."

**Key Message:** watsonx Orchestrate is a powerful yet accessible platform. Your teams can use their existing skills (Python, APIs) to rapidly build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade AI agents.

### **Section 6: Business Value & ROI (15:30 - 17:00)**

**(Timing: 1.5 minutes)**

**[SCREEN: Slide summarizing key business value points with icons]**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Let's bring this back to the business value for Starbucks."
*   **Boost Partner Productivity & Satisfaction:**
    *   By providing instant, 24/7 self-service, you give time back to your partners. A happier, more engaged workforce delivers a better customer experience—the cornerstone of your brand.
*   **Drive Operational Efficiency:**
    *   We can automate up to 60-70% of your Tier 1 HR inquiries. This drastically reduces the ticket volume for your support teams, freeing them to focus on complex, high-value partner issues, like career development and conflict resolution.
*   **Accelerate Time to Value:**
    *   Because Orchestrate is built on an open, developer-friendly framework, you can go from idea to a working proof-of-concept in weeks, not months or years. You can start with one use case, like HR, and easily expand to IT, Finance, or even store operations.

**Key Message:** This isn't just a technology investment; it's an investment in your people and your operational efficiency, with a clear and rapid return.

### **Section 7: Q&A Preparation (17:00 - 19:00)**

**(Timing: 2 minutes)**

**Presenter:** "I'd like to open it up for any questions you may have."

**Anticipated Questions & Answers:**

*   **Q: How does this connect to our real, proprietary systems?**
    *   **A:** "Great question. The tools we showed today can be configured to connect to any system with an API. Using our secure connection capabilities, we can link to your actual HRIS, payroll, and benefits platforms. For systems without APIs, we can leverage Robotic Process Automation (RPA) as a tool to interact with them."
*   **Q: What about security and data privacy? The agent is handling sensitive employee information.**
    *   **A:** "Security is paramount. watsonx Orchestrate is built on IBM's enterprise-grade cloud. Access is controlled through user authentication, and tool permissions can be set so that only authorized agents and users can access sensitive data or perform critical actions. All data in transit and at rest is encrypted."
*   **Q: How is this different from the generative AI or chatbot tools we're already looking at?**
    *   **A:** "The key differentiator is in our name: **Orchestrate**. Most chatbots or GenAI tools are focused on conversation and information retrieval. We do that well, but our core strength is turning that conversation into **action**. The ability to have agents collaborate and execute multi-step workflows across different backend systems is what sets us apart and delivers true automation."
*   **Q: What does the implementation process look like?**
    *   **A:** "We recommend starting with a focused, high-value use case like this one. We would typically begin with a discovery workshop with your HR and IT teams to map out the top 3-5 support journeys you want to automate. From there, we can build a proof-of-concept in just a few weeks to demonstrate the value on your own systems."

### **Section 8: Next Steps & Call to Action (19:00 - 20:00)**

**(Timing: 1 minute)**

**[SCREEN: Final slide with a clear call to action]**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Thank you again for your time today. We've shown you how the `Partner_Support_Agent`, powered by watsonx Orchestrate, can transform your employee support model from a fragmented process into a seamless, intelligent, and automated experience."
*   "This is about empowering your partners, supercharging your HR team, and driving a new level of efficiency across your organization."
*   "As a next step, we would like to propose a complimentary, two-hour discovery workshop with your team. In that session, we can identify and map out the perfect pilot use case for Starbucks and outline a clear plan for a proof-of-concept."
*   "Who would be the right person on your team to coordinate scheduling that session?"
