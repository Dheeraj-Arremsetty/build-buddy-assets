## Execution Plan

# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan

## Overview
This execution plan is designed to implement a comprehensive demonstration of IBM watsonx Orchestrate for automating Apple Developer Support processes. The goal is to showcase the platform's capability to reduce support ticket volume by 60%, provide 24/7 instant responses, and improve developer satisfaction. The demonstration involves creating and deploying multiple agents and tools that automate documentation retrieval, policy compliance checks, troubleshooting, and query routing, using synthetic data to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites
1. **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: Ensure the latest version is installed and configured. Follow the [IBM installation guide](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/getting_started/installing).
2. **Python Environment**: Python 3.8 or higher is required for tool development.
3. **Synthetic Data**: Prepare mock developer documentation, policy documents, and support ticket data.
4. **Dependencies**: Install necessary Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. **Knowledge Base Setup**: Ensure access to a Milvus or Elasticsearch instance, or prepare document uploads for the built-in Milvus instance.

## Step 1: Create YAML Configuration

### Documentation Retrieval Agent
**Purpose**: Automates the search and retrieval of developer documentation, enhancing support efficiency.

**Business Value**: Reduces manual search time, provides instant access to documentation, and improves developer experience.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: documentation_retrieval_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  An agent designed to automate the retrieval of developer documentation using the doc_search_tool.

description: >
  An agent to route and prioritize developer queries using the query_router and priority_manager.
instructions: >
  Use query_router to direct queries and priority_manager to prioritize them based on urgency.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - query_router
  - priority_manager
```

## Step 2: Create Tools

### Documentation Search Tool
**Purpose**: Searches and retrieves developer documentation efficiently.

**Business Value**: Enables quick access to relevant documents, reducing response times.

**Technical Implementation**:

```python
# doc_search_tool.py
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

@tool(name="doc_search_tool", description="Searches for developer documentation based on query")
def doc_search_tool(query: str) -> dict:
    """Searches for documentation matching the given query.

    Args:
        query (str): The search query for documentation.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing document titles and URLs.
    """
    # Mock implementation with synthetic data
    documents = {
        "query": query,
        "results": [
            {"title": "API Documentation", "url": "https://developer.apple.com/api-docs"},
            {"title": "User Guide", "url": "https://developer.apple.com/user-guide"}
        ]
    }
    return documents
```

### Policy Checker Tool
**Purpose**: Checks app submissions for policy compliance.

**Business Value**: Ensures submissions meet guidelines, reducing rejections and enhancing compliance.

**Technical Implementation**:

```python
# policy_checker_tool.py
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

@tool(name="policy_checker_tool", description="Checks app submissions for policy compliance")
def policy_checker_tool(submission: dict) -> dict:
    """Verifies compliance of the given app submission.

    Args:
        submission (dict): The app submission details.

    Returns:
        dict: A compliance report with issues.
    """
    # Mock implementation with synthetic data
    compliance_report = {
        "status": "passed",
        "issues": []
    }
    return compliance_report
```

### Troubleshoot Tool
**Purpose**: Diagnoses and resolves common app issues.

**Business Value**: Automates issue resolution, reducing downtime and improving user experience.

**Technical Implementation**:

```python
# troubleshoot_tool.py

from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

@tool(name="query_router", description="Routes queries to the appropriate support channels")
def query_router(query: dict) -> dict:
    """Routes the given query to the appropriate channel.

    Args:
        query (dict): The developer support query.

    Returns:
        dict: Routing information.
    """
    # Mock implementation with synthetic data
    routing_info = {

orchestrate agents import -f documentation_retrieval_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f policy_compliance_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f troubleshooting_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f query_routing_agent.yaml
```

## Verification
- **Testing**: Deploy agents and tools in a test environment. Execute queries and simulate scenarios to validate functionality and response accuracy.
- **Mock Data Validation**: Ensure synthetic data is correctly formatted and accessible by agents.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure the response time and accuracy of each agent and tool.

## Troubleshooting
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Import Errors**: Verify YAML and Python files are correctly formatted and paths are accurate.
  - **Data Retrieval Failures**: Ensure synthetic data is correctly loaded and accessible.
- **Solutions**:
  - **Error Logs**: Examine logs for detailed error messages and address any misconfigurations.
  - **Environment Setup**: Confirm all prerequisites are met and dependencies are installed.

## Best Practices
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for all agents and tools for scalability.
- **Synthetic Data**: Regularly update synthetic data to reflect realistic scenarios for continuous testing.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling in tools to manage unexpected issues gracefully.

By following this plan, the client will effectively demonstrate the capabilities of IBM watsonx Orchestrate in automating developer support processes, achieving the desired business outcomes of reduced ticket volumes and enhanced developer satisfaction.
