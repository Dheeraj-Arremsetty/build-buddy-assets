3.  **Focus on Governance:** With its watsonx platform, IBM emphasizes AI governance, ethics, and transparency, appealing to enterprises concerned with risk and compliance.

### **2. Financial Status**

IBM is a mature, large-cap company focused on stable revenue, profitability, and shareholder returns through dividends.

*   **Valuation & Revenue:** For the fiscal year 2024, IBM's total global revenue stood at approximately **$62 billion** (Source 2).
*   **Segment Performance (Q2 2024):** The company's second-quarter results highlight the current composition of its business (Source 1):
    *   **Software:** $6.74 billion
    *   **Consulting:** $5.18 billion
    *   **Infrastructure:** $3.65 billion
*   **Financial Health Analysis:** The financial data confirms the success of IBM's strategic shift. The Software segment is the largest revenue contributor, generating over **$27 billion** annually, or roughly 44% of the company's total revenue (Source 2). This high-margin business, combined with the robust Consulting segment, underscores the move away from lower-margin infrastructure services, a process accelerated by the 2021 spin-off of its managed infrastructure business into the new company, Kyndryl. While IBM does not exhibit the explosive growth of some tech rivals, it maintains strong profitability and free cash flow, indicating a stable financial position.

### **3. Revenue Generation**

IBM's income is generated through three primary business segments, which function in a symbiotic relationship.
