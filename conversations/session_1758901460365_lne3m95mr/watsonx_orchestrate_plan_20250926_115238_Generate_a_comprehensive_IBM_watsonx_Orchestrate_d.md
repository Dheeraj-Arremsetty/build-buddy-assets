## Execution Plan

# Comprehensive IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Plan

## Overview

This execution plan provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for creating a comprehensive IBM watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for a financial services client. The demo showcases a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to automate the complex and time-consuming process of quarterly financial compliance reporting. By orchestrating data retrieval, processing, compliance analysis, and report generation, this solution directly addresses the client's challenges with manual workflows, data silos, and reporting delays.

The architecture features a supervisor agent that delegates tasks to specialized collaborator agents, each equipped with a set of powerful tools. This modular design demonstrates how watsonx Orchestrate can connect to disparate enterprise systems (simulated via tools with synthetic data), enforce complex business logic, and deliver accurate, audited results with speed and efficiency. The plan includes complete code examples, configuration files, and commands, all based on official IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK patterns and best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is properly configured. This is crucial for the successful creation and deployment of the agents and tools outlined in this plan.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit must be installed and configured. This is the primary toolset for building, importing, and managing agents. Follow the official documentation for installation.
    ```bash
    # Example installation command
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
2.  **Python Environment**: A Python version compatible with the ADK (e.g., Python 3.10 or later) is required. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Project Directory Structure**: Create a structured directory to organize all artifacts for the demo. This separation of concerns simplifies development and deployment.
    ```
    gfc_demo/
    ├── agents/
    │   ├── 01_data_retrieval_agent.yaml
    │   ├── 02_data_processing_agent.yaml
    │   ├── 03_compliance_analysis_agent.yaml
    │   ├── 04_report_generation_agent.yaml
    │   └── 05_supervisor_reporting_agent.yaml
    ├── tools/
    │   ├── retrieval_tools.py
    │   ├── processing_tools.py
    │   ├── analysis_tools.py
    │   └── reporting_tools.py
    ├── knowledge_base/
    │   ├── compliance_kb.yaml
    │   └── documents/
    │       └── compliance_policies.pdf  # A placeholder PDF with sample compliance rules
    └── requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Python Libraries**: The tools will require the `requests` library for simulated API calls. Create a `requirements.txt` file to manage this.

## Step 1: Create the `requirements.txt` File

This file lists all the Python packages your tools depend on. Using a requirements file ensures a consistent and reproducible environment.

**File:** `gfc_demo/requirements.txt`
```text
requests
python-dotenv
```

**Command to Install Dependencies:**
Execute this command from the root of your `gfc_demo` directory.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Create the Python Tools

The tools are the functional backbone of the agents, performing specific actions like data retrieval and analysis. Each tool is a Python function decorated with `@tool`, containing a detailed docstring that watsonx Orchestrate uses to understand its purpose, arguments, and return values. For this demo, the tools will generate realistic synthetic data to simulate interactions with real enterprise systems like CRMs and ERPs.

### 2.1 Data Retrieval Tools

These tools simulate fetching raw data from various financial systems. They are essential for the `data_retrieval_agent` to gather the necessary information for the report.

**Business Value:** This demonstrates Orchestrate's ability to connect to and aggregate data from multiple, disparate sources, breaking down data silos and providing a unified view of business operations.

**File:** `gfc_demo/tools/retrieval_tools.py`
```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="get_sales_data", description="Retrieves sales transaction data for a specified quarter from the CRM system.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_sales_data(quarter: str) -> str:
    """
    Fetches all sales transactions for a given quarter (e.g., 'Q2 2024').

    Args:
        quarter (str): The quarter for which to retrieve sales data, in 'Q# YYYY' format.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing a list of sales transactions.
    """
    transactions = []
    for i in range(15):  # Generate 15 realistic records
        transaction_date = datetime(2024, 4, 1) + timedelta(days=random.randint(0, 89))
        transactions.append({
            "transaction_id": f"SALE-{'%04d' % (i+1)}",
            "date": transaction_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            "product_id": f"PROD-{random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'])}{random.randint(100, 200)}",
            "region": random.choice(["NA", "EMEA", "APAC"]),
            "amount": round(random.uniform(5000.0, 75000.0), 2),
            "currency": "USD",
            "status": "Completed"
        })
    return json.dumps({"sales_data": transactions})

@tool(name="get_expense_data", description="Retrieves employee expense records for a specified quarter from the ERP system.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_expense_data(quarter: str) -> str:
    """
    Fetches all employee expense records for a given quarter (e.g., 'Q2 2024').

    Args:
        quarter (str): The quarter for which to retrieve expense data, in 'Q# YYYY' format.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing a list of expense records
