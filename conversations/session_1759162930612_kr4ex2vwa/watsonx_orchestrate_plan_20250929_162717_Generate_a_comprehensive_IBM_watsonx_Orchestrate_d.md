# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Enterprise Process Automation

## 1. Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building a powerful watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for an enterprise client in a regulated industry. The client's primary challenge lies in manual, time-consuming, and error-prone processes for data collection, aggregation, compliance validation, and reporting. This demo will showcase how a "digital labor" team of specialized AI agents can automate this entire workflow, ensuring accuracy, speed, and auditability.

We will construct a multi-agent system composed of a `enterprise_process_supervisor` agent that orchestrates four specialized collaborator agents: a `data_collection_agent`, a `data_processing_agent`, a `compliance_analysis_agent`, and a `reporting_generation_agent`. This architecture demonstrates a sophisticated digital labor pattern, where tasks are intelligently delegated and results are consolidated, mimicking an efficient human operational team. The entire demo will leverage a mock data strategy, using Python-based tools to generate realistic synthetic data, thus eliminating the need for complex live system integrations during the proof-of-concept phase.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for using the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) to build and deploy the agents and tools.

*   **Python:** Version 3.9 or higher.
*   **pip:** Python's package installer, which is typically included with Python installations.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK:** The core library and command-line interface (CLI) for building agents. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
*   **Text Editor/IDE:** A code editor like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text for creating and editing Python and YAML files.
*   **Orchestrate Environment:** You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. Follow the official documentation to initialize your environment using the CLI.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 3.1: Project Setup

First, create a structured directory for your project. This organization helps manage the various agent configurations and tool scripts cleanly.

1.  Create a main project folder:
    ```bash
    mkdir orchestrate-enterprise-demo
    cd orchestrate-enterprise-demo
    ```
2.  Create subdirectories for agents and tools:
    ```bash
    mkdir agents
    mkdir tools
    ```

Your project structure should look like this:
```
orchestrate-enterprise-demo/
├── agents/
└── tools/
```

### Step 3.2: Create Python Tools (Synthetic Data Generation)

The tools are the foundation of this demo, acting as mock APIs to enterprise systems. Each tool is a Python function that generates realistic, synthetic data, simulating the retrieval of information from systems like CRM, ERP, and ticketing platforms.

#### 3.2.1 Data Collection Tools

These tools simulate fetching raw data from various enterprise sources. Create a file named `tools/collection_tools.py`.

**File: `tools/collection_tools.py`**
```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="fetch_crm_data", description="Fetches customer relationship management (CRM) data for a given quarter, including sales opportunities and account details.")
def fetch_crm_data(quarter: str) -> str:
    """
    Simulates fetching CRM data including sales opportunities, account info, and deal sizes for a specified quarter.

    Args:
        quarter (str): The financial quarter to fetch data for (e.g., 'Q2').

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of CRM records.
    """
    records = []
    for i in range(15):
        records.append({
            "opportunity_id": f"OPP-{random.randint(1000, 9999)}",
            "account_name": f"Enterprise Client {chr(65+i)}",
            "deal_size": random.randint(50000, 500000),
            "stage": random.choice(["Discovery", "Proposal", "Negotiation", "Closed Won"]),
            "close_date": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=random.randint(1, 90))).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            "region": random.choice(["NA", "EMEA", "APAC"])
        })
    return json.dumps({"status": "success", "record_count": len(records), "data": records})

@tool(name="fetch_erp_data", description="Fetches enterprise resource planning (ERP) data, such as financial transactions and expense reports.")
def fetch_erp_data(quarter: str) -> str:
    """
    Simulates fetching ERP financial data including transaction IDs, amounts, and categories for a specified quarter.

    Args:
        quarter (str): The financial quarter to fetch data for (e.g., 'Q2').

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of financial transactions.
    """
    transactions = []
    for _ in range(20):
        transactions.append({
            "transaction_id": f"TRN-{random.randint(10000, 99999)}",
            "amount": round(random.uniform(1000.0, 25000.0), 2),

            "category": random.choice(["Software License", "Hardware Purchase", "Consulting Services", "Travel & Expense"]),
            "cost_center": f"CC-{random.randint(101, 105)}"
        })
    return json.dumps({"status": "success", "record_count": len(transactions), "data": transactions})

@tool(name="fetch_support_tickets", description="Fetches customer support ticket data, including ticket status and priority.")
def fetch_support_tickets(time_period_days: int = 90) -> str:
