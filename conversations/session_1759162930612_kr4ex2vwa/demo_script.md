### **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo: The Starbucks Partner Pod Assistant**

**Presenter:** IBM watsonx Orchestrate Specialist
**Audience:** Starbucks Operations, HR, and IT Leadership
**Duration:** 20 Minutes

### **Section 1: The Morning Rush & The Onboarding Challenge (3 Minutes)**

**(Opening Narrative)**

**Presenter:** "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today.

We all know the feeling of walking into a Starbucks during the morning rush. The energy is electric, the aroma of coffee is in the air, and there’s a complex, perfectly synchronized dance happening behind the counter. That dance is performed by your partners—your baristas. They are the heart of the customer experience.

But what happens when one of those dancers is new?

Imagine a new partner, let's call her Alex. It's her first week. The line is growing, a customer asks for a complex custom order, and the store manager is busy handling a supplier delivery. Alex has a simple question about the correct milk steaming sequence for a flat white, a question that’s answered on page 47 of a training manual she reviewed three days ago.

In that moment, she feels stuck. She can either interrupt her busy manager, guess and risk making the drink incorrectly, or take extra time searching for the answer, slowing down the entire line. This single moment encapsulates the core challenge of retail onboarding."

**(Problem Statement)**

*   **The Challenge:** "This scenario highlights three key business challenges you face every day:"
    *   **1. Manager Bandwidth:** Your store managers are your most valuable operational assets. Every minute they spend answering repetitive training questions is a minute not spent on customer engagement, inventory management, or team coaching.
    *   **2. Inconsistent Training:** On-the-job training, while essential, can vary from manager to manager and store to store. This can lead to inconsistencies in drink quality and customer service, which directly impacts your brand promise.
    *   **3. Slower Ramp-Up Time:** The faster a new partner becomes confident and proficient, the faster they deliver value. A lengthy onboarding process impacts store efficiency, increases the burden on tenured staff, and can affect new hire morale, potentially leading to higher turnover.

### **Section 2: The Solution - The Partner Pod Assistant (2 Minutes)**

**(Introducing the Vision)**

**Presenter:** "What if we could give every new partner, like Alex, an expert mentor available 24/7, right on their in-store tablet? A mentor that has perfectly memorized every training manual, every beverage recipe, and every company policy. A mentor that can answer questions instantly, in natural language, and even help with operational tasks.

That’s exactly what we’ve built using **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**. We call it the **'Partner Pod Assistant.'**"

**(Value Proposition)**

*   **What it is:** "The Partner Pod Assistant is an AI agent, powered by watsonx Orchestrate, that lives on your in-store tablets. It’s been trained on your proprietary knowledge base—your official training manuals, beverage recipe cards, and HR policies."
*   **How it helps:** "It acts as a digital expert, empowering new hires to find answers and solve problems independently. This accomplishes three primary goals:"
    *   **Empowers New Hires:** Reduces anxiety and builds confidence by providing instant, accurate answers.
    *   **Frees Up Managers:** Allows managers to focus on high-value leadership and operational tasks.
    *   **Ensures Consistency:** Guarantees that every partner receives the same, brand-approved information, every single time.

"Let me show you how it works."

### **Section 3: Live Demo - A Day in the Life of a New Partner (8 Minutes)**

**(Presenter moves to a tablet/demo screen interface styled with Starbucks branding)**

**Presenter:** "Let's go back to our new partner, Alex. She's on the floor and has the Partner Pod Assistant open on her tablet. We'll walk through a few common scenarios."

---

#### **Demo Scenario 1: Foundational Knowledge - The Recipe Question**

**Presenter:** "First, a simple recipe question. Alex needs a quick refresher on a signature drink."

*   **(Presenter types or speaks into the demo interface):**
    > **Prompt:** "How do I make a grande Caramel Macchiato, and what are the key steps?"

*   **(Expected Outcome):** The AI responds instantly with a clear, concise, and formatted answer.

    > **AI Response:** "Of course! Here are the steps for a grande Caramel Macchiato, based on the *Beverage Recipe Manual (BRM), page 23*:
    >
    > 1.  **Prep:** Queue 2 shots of espresso.
    > 2.  **Milk:** Steam 2% milk to 150-160°F, ensuring a fine micro-foam.
    > 3.  **Syrup:** Pump 3 pumps of Vanilla Syrup into the grande cup.
    > 4.  **Combine:** Pour the steamed milk into the cup, holding back the foam.
    > 5.  **Espresso:** Pour the 2 espresso shots slowly over the top of the milk. They should 'mark' the foam.
    > 6.  **Topping:** Top with a crosshatch pattern of Caramel Drizzle.
    >
    > **Key Tip:** The 'marking' of the foam by the espresso is the signature of a well-made Macchiato!"

**Talking Points:**

*   "Notice the response is not just a block of text. It's structured, easy to read, and even provides a page citation from your own document. This is the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) working with your knowledge base."
*   "This is faster and more reliable than flipping through a binder or asking a coworker."

---

#### **Demo Scenario 2: Policy & Procedure - The Customer Service Question**

**Presenter:** "Now for a more nuanced situation. A customer is unhappy with their drink. Alex needs to know the correct, brand-approved procedure."

*   **(Presenter types or speaks):**
    > **Prompt:** "A customer said their latte is too cold. What's the 'LATTE' model for handling this?"

*   **(Expected Outcome):** The AI provides the specific, branded policy guidance.

    > **AI Response:** "Great question. Handling customer feedback is key. Here is the 'LATTE' model from the *Partner Guide, Section 4.2*:
    >
    > *   **L - Listen:** Give the customer your full attention and listen to their concern.
    > *   **A - Apologize:** Offer a sincere apology for their experience.
    > *   **T - Take Action:** Offer to remake the drink immediately, or suggest an alternative.
    > *   **T - Thank:** Thank the customer for bringing the issue to your attention.
    > *   **E - Ensure Satisfaction:** Follow up to make sure their new beverage is perfect.
    >
    > Remember to remain positive and focused on making the moment right for the customer."

**Talking Points:**

*   "This is about more than just recipes; it's about embedding your culture and service standards. Every new hire gets the exact same, perfect answer, ensuring brand consistency across all 30,000 stores."

---

#### **Demo Scenario 3: Taking Action - Orchestrating a Task**

**Presenter:** "This is where we go beyond just answering questions. This is the 'Orchestrate' in watsonx Orchestrate. The AI can use tools to perform actions. Let's say the scanner on the point-of-sale system is malfunctioning."

*   **(Presenter types or speaks):**
    > **Prompt:** "The barcode scanner on Terminal 2 isn't working. I've already tried restarting it."

*   **(Expected Outcome):** The AI recognizes the need for action and uses a tool to create an IT support ticket.

    > **AI Response:** "I'm sorry to hear that. Since a restart didn't work, I will log a support ticket for you.
    >
    > **Action:** Creating IT Support Ticket...
    > **Tool Used:** `create_support_ticket`
    > **Details:**
    >   *   **Store ID:** #12345 (Seattle Main St)
    >   *   **Asset:** POS Terminal 2
    >   *   **Issue:** Barcode scanner unresponsive
    >   *   **Urgency:** High
    >
    > **Ticket #INC0078945 has been created.** The tech support team has been notified. Your store manager will receive a confirmation email."

**Talking Points:**

*   **This is the key differentiator.** The assistant didn't just tell Alex *how* to file a ticket; it *did it for her*.
*   "watsonx Orchestrate seamlessly connected to a tool—in this case, a simulated function to log a ticket in a system like ServiceNow. It automated a multi-step business process from a simple, natural language request."

### **Section 4: How It Works - The Power of watsonx Orchestrate (2 Minutes)**

**(Show a simplified architectural diagram)**

**Presenter:** "What you just saw isn't magic; it's a powerful combination of capabilities brought together by the watsonx Orchestrate platform. Let's quickly look under the hood."

1.  **The Brain (Large Language Model):** At the core is a powerful LLM from IBM's watsonx.ai platform. It understands the user's intent from their natural language questions.

2.  **The Library (Knowledge Base):** We connected Orchestrate to a knowledge base containing your documents—PDFs of training manuals, Word docs of policies, etc. When a question is asked, the RAG pattern finds the most relevant passages to ensure the answer is grounded in your specific truth.

    *(Briefly show a sample YAML snippet)*
    ```yaml
    # Barista Assistant Knowledge Base Definition
    kind: knowledge_base
    name: starbucks_training_kb
    description: >
      Contains all official Starbucks training manuals, beverage recipes,
      and partner policy guides for onboarding.
    documents:
      - "docs/beverage_recipe_manual_2025.pdf"
      - "docs/partner_onboarding_guide.docx"
      - "docs/customer_service_policies.txt"
    ```

3.  **The Hands (Tools):** For the ticket creation, the agent used a 'tool.' Tools are skills you give to the agent. Using the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, your developers can easily create custom tools in Python that connect to your existing APIs and backend systems—whether it's your IT service desk, inventory system, or HR platform.

    *(Briefly show a sample Python snippet)*
    ```python
    # A simplified tool to create a support ticket
    from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

    @tool
    def create_support_ticket(asset: str, issue: str) -> str:
        """Creates an IT support ticket for faulty in-store equipment."""
        print(f"Connecting to IT Service Desk API...")
        # ... logic to call the real API ...
        ticket_id = "INC0078945" # Dummy ID for demo
        return f"Successfully created ticket {ticket_id}."
    ```

"watsonx Orchestrate is the platform that brings all of this together, intelligently deciding whether to answer from the knowledge base or execute an action with a tool."

### **Section 6: Q&A and Next Steps (2 Minutes)**

**Presenter:** "I'd like to open it up for any questions you may have."

**(Anticipated Q&A)**

*   **Q: How difficult is it to add our own documents to the knowledge base?**
    *   **A:** It's very straightforward. The platform supports common formats like PDF, DOCX, and TXT. You can update and add new documents through the ADK or UI, and the knowledge base is refreshed automatically.
*   **Q: Can this integrate with our existing IT systems, like ServiceNow?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely. That's a core strength of Orchestrate. The ADK allows your developers to build tools that connect to any system with an API. We demonstrated this with the ticket creation.
*   **Q: How does the AI handle questions it doesn't know the answer to?**
    *   **A:** It's designed to be safe and avoid making things up. If it can't find a relevant answer in the knowledge base, it will respond honestly, saying it doesn't have the information and will advise the partner to ask their manager, which is the correct fallback procedure.
*   **Q: What about security and our proprietary data?**
    *   **A:** This is built on IBM watsonx, an enterprise-grade platform designed for trust and security. Your data is your own. It is used solely to train and operate your assistant within your secure environment.

**(Call to Action)**

**Presenter:** "Thank you. Our vision is to put a trusted AI co-pilot in the hands of every Starbucks partner.

As a next step, we propose a **two-hour discovery workshop** with your operations and IT teams. In this session, we can identify the top 3-5 use cases beyond onboarding and map out a tailored Proof of Concept plan to bring the Partner Pod Assistant to life in a pilot store.

Thank you for your time."
