# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan for FinSecure Capital

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for demonstrating the capabilities of IBM watsonx Orchestrate to FinSecure Capital. The demo is tailored to address their primary challenge: automating the manual, slow, and error-prone loan application processing workflow. We will build a multi-agent system that automates the entire process, from initial data collection and risk assessment to final compliance reporting.

This solution will showcase how watsonx Orchestrate can create a sophisticated "digital labor" pattern by orchestrating multiple specialized agents. The `LoanProcessingSupervisor_Agent` will act as a manager, delegating tasks to a team of collaborator agents: `DataCollection_Agent`, `RiskAssessment_Agent`, and `ReportGeneration_Agent`. This architecture demonstrates enterprise-grade process automation, improving efficiency, ensuring consistent risk evaluation, and simplifying regulatory compliance for FinSecure Capital.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is set up correctly. This is crucial for the successful creation and deployment of the agents and tools.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed and configured. If you haven't installed it, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate"
    ```
2.  **Python Environment**: A working Python environment (version 3.9 or higher) is required. This environment should have `pip` available for installing packages.
3.  **Project Directory Structure**: To keep the project organized, create the following directory structure. This separation of agents and tools is a best practice for managing complex Orchestrate projects.
    ```
    FinSecure_Demo/
    ├── agents/
    │   ├── DataCollection_Agent.yaml
    │   ├── RiskAssessment_Agent.yaml
    │   ├── ReportGeneration_Agent.yaml
    │   └── LoanProcessingSupervisor_Agent.yaml
    ├── tools/
    │   ├── data_collection_tools.py
    │   ├── risk_assessment_tools.py
    │   └── report_generation_tools.py
    └── requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Orchestrate Environment Initialization**: Ensure you have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. You can list your environments using `orchestrate env list` and set the active one using `orchestrate env use <your_env_name>`.

## Step 1: Create the Python Tools

The foundation of any powerful agent is its set of tools. These Python functions will perform the specific actions required for loan processing, such as fetching data, performing calculations, and generating reports. Each tool generates realistic, synthetic data to simulate interactions with FinSecure Capital's real-world systems.

### 1.1 Data Collection Tools

These tools simulate gathering applicant information from various internal and external data sources, such as a CRM, credit bureaus, and document management systems.

**Business Value:** This automates the time-consuming and manual process of data aggregation, reducing errors and freeing up loan officers to focus on higher-value tasks. It ensures that a complete and consistent data profile is available for every applicant before the assessment begins.

Create the file `tools/data_collection_tools.py`:

```python
# tools/data_collection_tools.py

import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_applicant_details(applicant_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Fetches basic details for a loan applicant from the primary CRM system.

    Args:
        applicant_id (str): The unique identifier for the applicant.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing the applicant's details, including name, contact information, and employment status.
    """
    print(f"Fetching details for applicant ID: {applicant_id}")
    applicants = {
        "789123": {"full_name": "Alice Johnson", "email": "alice.j@example.com", "phone": "555-0101", "employment_status": "Employed", "years_at_employer": 5},
        "456789": {"full_name": "Bob Williams", "email": "bob.w@example.com", "phone": "555-0102", "employment_status": "Self-Employed", "years_at_employer": 8},
    }
    data = applicants.get(applicant_id, {"error": "Applicant not found"})
    return json.dumps({"status": "success", "applicant_id": applicant_id, "data": data})

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_credit_score(applicant_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves the credit score for a given applicant by simulating a call to a credit bureau API.

    Args:
        applicant_id (str): The unique identifier for the applicant.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing the credit score and the reporting bureau.
    """
    print(f"Getting credit score for applicant ID: {applicant_id}")
    # Simulate different scores for different applicants
    scores = {
        "789123": random.randint(720, 850),
        "456789": random.randint(650, 719),
    }
    score = scores.get(applicant_id, random.randint(500, 649))
    bureau = random.choice(["Equifax", "Experian", "TransUnion"])
    return json.dumps({"status": "success", "applicant_id": applicant_id, "credit_score": score, "bureau": bureau})

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def retrieve_financial_statements(applicant_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves financial statement summaries for an applicant, such as annual income and total assets/liabilities.

    Args:
        applicant_id (str): The unique identifier for the applicant.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing a summary of the applicant's financial statements.
    """
    print(f"Retrieving financials for applicant ID: {applicant_id}")
    financials = {
        "789123": {
            "annual_income": 120000,
            "total_assets": 550000,
            "total_liabilities": 150000,
            "monthly_debt_payments": 2500
        },
        "456789": {
            "annual_income": 85000,
            "total_assets": 200000,

            "monthly_debt_payments": 3000
        },
    }
    data = financials.get(applicant_id, {"error": "Financial statements not available"})
    return json.dumps({"status": "success", "applicant_id": applicant_id, "financials": data})
```

### 1.2 Risk Assessment Tools

These tools perform calculations and analysis on the collected data to determine the risk associated with a loan application.

**Business Value:** This standardizes the risk assessment process, ensuring that all applications are evaluated against the same criteria. It provides an objective, data-driven basis for decision-making, reducing bias and improving the quality of the loan portfolio.

Create the file `tools/risk_assessment_tools.py`:

```python
# tools/risk_assessment_tools.py

import json
import random
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def calculate_debt_to_income_ratio(annual_income: float, monthly_debt_payments: float) -> str:
    """
    Calculates the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio, a key metric in loan risk assessment.

    Args:
        annual_income (float): The applicant's total annual income.
        monthly_debt_payments (float): The applicant's total monthly debt payments.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing the calculated monthly income and DTI ratio as a percentage.
    """
    if annual_income <= 0:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": "Annual income must be positive."})
    
    monthly_income = annual_income / 12
    dti_ratio = (monthly_debt_payments / monthly_income) * 100
    
    return json.dumps({
        "status": "success",
        "monthly_income": round(monthly_income, 2),
        "dti_ratio_percentage": round(dti_ratio, 2)
    })

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def analyze_risk_factors(credit_score: int, dti_ratio: float) -> str:
    """
    Analyzes key risk factors (credit score, DTI) to generate a risk score and recommendation.

    Args:
        credit_score (int): The applicant's credit score.
        dti_ratio (float): The applicant's debt-to-income ratio percentage.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string with a calculated risk score (1-10), risk level, and a funding recommendation.
    """
    risk_score = 5  # Start with a neutral score
    
    if credit_score >= 740:
        risk_score -= 3
    elif credit_score >= 670:
        risk_score -= 1
    elif credit_score
