2.  **Python Environment**: A working Python environment (version 3.9 or higher) is required. This environment should have `pip` available for installing packages.
3.  **Project Directory Structure**: To keep the project organized, create the following directory structure. This separation of agents and tools is a best practice for managing complex Orchestrate projects.
    ```
    FinSecure_Demo/
    ├── agents/
    │   ├── DataCollection_Agent.yaml
    │   ├── RiskAssessment_Agent.yaml
    │   ├── ReportGeneration_Agent.yaml
    │   └── LoanProcessingSupervisor_Agent.yaml
    ├── tools/
    │   ├── data_collection_tools.py
    │   ├── risk_assessment_tools.py
    │   └── report_generation_tools.py
    └── requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Orchestrate Environment Initialization**: Ensure you have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. You can list your environments using `orchestrate env list` and set the active one using `orchestrate env use <your_env_name>`.

## Step 1: Create the Python Tools

The foundation of any powerful agent is its set of tools. These Python functions will perform the specific actions required for loan processing, such as fetching data, performing calculations, and generating reports. Each tool generates realistic, synthetic data to simulate interactions with FinSecure Capital's real-world systems.

### 1.1 Data Collection Tools

These tools simulate gathering applicant information from various internal and external data sources, such as a CRM, credit bureaus, and document management systems.

**Business Value:** This automates the time-consuming and manual process of data aggregation, reducing errors and freeing up loan officers to focus on higher-value tasks. It ensures that a complete and consistent data profile is available for every applicant before the assessment begins.

Create the file `tools/data_collection_tools.py`:
