# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan for FinCorp Analytics

## Overview
This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building a sophisticated, multi-agent demonstration for FinCorp Analytics using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The primary business challenge this demo addresses is the automation of the complex, manual, and time-consuming quarterly market risk analysis reporting process. Currently, this process requires significant effort to gather data from disparate sources, perform risk calculations, check for compliance against internal and external regulations, and compile a final report for executive review. This manual workflow is prone to errors, inconsistencies, and delays, which can impact strategic decision-making.

The proposed solution leverages a powerful multi-agent architecture within watsonx Orchestrate. A central `Market_Risk_Supervisor_Agent` orchestrates a team of specialized collaborator agents, each responsible for a specific stage of the workflow: data ingestion, risk analysis, compliance verification, and report generation. This approach not only automates the end-to-end process but also introduces modularity, scalability, and improved accuracy. By simulating this workflow with realistic synthetic data, this demo will showcase how FinCorp Analytics can transform its risk reporting function, reducing turnaround times from days to minutes, enhancing compliance adherence, and freeing up analysts to focus on higher-value strategic interpretation rather than manual data wrangling.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure your development environment is properly configured. This setup is crucial for the successful creation, import, and execution of the agents and tools outlined in this plan.

*   **Python Environment**: A working installation of Python (version 3.8 or higher) is required.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed. This is the core library and CLI for building and managing Orchestrate assets.
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-adk"
    ```
*   **Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment initialized and configured. This connects your local ADK to your Orchestrate instance. If you haven't done so, run:
    ```bash
    orchestrate environment init
    ```
    Follow the prompts to log in and select your environment.
*   **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated folder for this project to keep all files organized.
*   **Text Editor/IDE**: A code editor such as Visual Studio Code is recommended for editing Python and YAML files.

## Step 1: Project Structure and Dependencies Setup
A well-organized project structure is essential for managing the different components of your solution.

### 1.1. Create Project Directories
Create the following directory and file structure within your main project folder (e.g., `fincorp_demo`).

```
fincorp_demo/
├── agents/
│   ├── 01_data_ingestion_agent.yaml
│   ├── 02_risk_analysis_agent.yaml
│   ├── 03_compliance_check_agent.yaml
│   ├── 04_report_generation_agent.yaml
│   └── 05_market_risk_supervisor_agent.yaml
├── tools/
│   ├── data_ingestion_tools.py
│   ├── risk_analysis_tools.py
│   ├── compliance_check_tools.py
│   └── report_generation_tools.py
└── requirements.txt
```

### 1.2. Create `requirements.txt`
This file lists the Python packages needed for the tools. For this demo, no external packages are required beyond the ADK, but it's a best practice to have this file.

**File:** `requirements.txt`
```
# No external packages required for these tools.
# The ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-adk provides the necessary decorators.
```

## Step 2: Create Python Tools
Tools are the functional building blocks of your agents, enabling them to perform specific actions. We will create four sets of tools, each in its own Python file. These tools will generate realistic synthetic data to simulate real-world operations without requiring live system integrations.

### 2.1. Data Ingestion Tools
**Business Value:** This toolset simulates the first critical step of any financial analysis: data aggregation. It automates the collection of diverse data types (market prices, economic indicators) from various sources, ensuring the analysis is based on timely and comprehensive information. This replaces manual data gathering, reduces errors, and accelerates the entire reporting lifecycle.

**File:** `tools/data_ingestion_tools.py`
```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission
from typing import List, Dict

@tool(name="fetch_market_data", description="Fetches the latest market data for a given list of stock tickers.")
def fetch_market_data(tickers: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Simulates fetching the latest market data including price, volume, and day's high/low for a specified list of stock tickers.

    Args:
        tickers (List[str]): A list of stock market tickers to fetch data for (e.g., ['IBM', 'GOOG', 'MSFT']).

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains market data for a ticker.
    """
    market_data = []
    for ticker in tickers:
        base_price = random.uniform(100.0, 500.0)
        market_data.append({
            "ticker": ticker,
            "price": round(base_price + random.uniform(-5.0, 5.0), 2),
            "volume": random.randint(1_000_000, 20_000_000),
            "day_high": round(base_price + random.uniform(2.0, 8.0), 2),
            "day_low": round(base_price - random.uniform(2.0, 8.0), 2),
            "timestamp": (datetime.now() - timedelta(minutes=random.randint(1, 60))).isoformat(),
            "metadata": {
                "source": "Simulated Market Feed",
                "quality_score": round(random.uniform(0.95, 0.99), 2)
            }
        })
    return json.dumps(market_data, indent=2)

@tool(name="get_economic_indicators", description="Retrieves key economic indicators relevant to market analysis.")
def get_economic_indicators() -> str:
    """
    Simulates retrieving major economic indicators like CPI, interest rates, and unemployment rates.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing a dictionary of key economic indicators.
    """
    indicators = {
        "consumer_price_index": {
            "value": round(random.uniform(2.5, 4.0), 2),
            "unit": "%",
            "change_mom": round(random.uniform(-0.2, 0.2), 2),
            "last_updated": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        },
        "federal_interest_rate": {
            "value": round(random.uniform(4.5, 5.5), 2),
            "unit": "%",
            "change_bps": random.choice([0, 25, -25]),
            "last_updated": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=15)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        },
        "unemployment_rate": {
            "value": round(random.uniform(3.5, 4.5), 2),
            "unit": "%",
            "last_updated": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=45)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        }
    }
    return json.dumps(indicators, indent=2)
```

### 2.2. Risk Analysis Tools
**Business Value:** These tools form the analytical core of the solution. They automate complex quantitative risk calculations, such as Value at Risk (VaR) and stress testing. By replacing manual spreadsheet models, they provide faster, more consistent, and auditable risk assessments, enabling analysts to quickly understand potential portfolio losses under various market conditions.

**File:** `tools/risk_analysis_tools.py`
```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission
from typing import Dict

@tool(name="calculate_var", description="Calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) for a given portfolio based on market data.")
def calculate_var(portfolio_data: str) -> str:
    """
    Simulates the calculation of Value at Risk (VaR) at a 95% confidence level for a portfolio.

    Args:
        portfolio_data (str): A JSON string of market data for the portfolio assets.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing the VaR calculation results.
    """
    try:
        data = json.loads(portfolio_data)
        total_value = sum(item['price'] for item in data)
        var_percentage = random.uniform(1.5, 3.0)
        var_value = total_value * (var_percentage / 100)
        
        result = {
            "value_at_risk": {
                "
