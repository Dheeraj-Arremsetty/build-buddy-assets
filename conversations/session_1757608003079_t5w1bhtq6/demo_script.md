### **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: Building a Resilient Supply Chain for Clorox**

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Demo Specialist Name]
**Audience:** Clorox Supply Chain, Operations, and IT Leadership
**Duration:** 20 Minutes

---

### **Part 1: Setting the Scene & The Business Challenge (0:00 - 3:00)**

**(Timing: 3 minutes)**

**Talking Points & Key Messages:**

*   **(Slide 1: Title Slide - IBM & Clorox Logos)**
    *   "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. We're here to discuss a challenge that's top-of-mind for every CPG leader: building a truly resilient and agile supply chain."
    *   "Our team has done its homework on Clorox. We understand your position as a market leader with incredible brand equity in brands like Pine-Sol, Burt's Bees, and of course, the flagship Clorox brand. Your strength is built on consumer trust."
    *   "We also understand the significant operational challenges you faced following the August 2023 cyberattack. The reports of a 20% drop in quarterly sales and a $49 million recovery cost highlight a critical vulnerability—not just in security, but in operational resilience when core systems are disrupted and manual processes become the only option."
    *   "This isn't a unique problem, but the impact at Clorox was profound. It underscores the immense pressure on your supply chain teams to have immediate, accurate information from disparate systems to make critical decisions under pressure."

*   **(Slide 2: The "Swivel Chair" Problem)**
    *   "Let's talk about a day in the life of a Supply Chain Manager, let's call her Sarah. A major retailer puts in an urgent, high-volume order for disinfecting wipes for their Northeast distribution centers."
    *   "Sarah's simple question is: **'Can we fulfill this order and meet the delivery deadline?'**"
    *   "But the answer isn't simple. Today, she has to:
        1.  Log into your **ERP system** to check finished goods inventory at multiple warehouses.
        2.  Then, pivot to the **Warehouse Management System (WMS)** to see the real-time status of order picking and packing.
        3.  Finally, she queries the **Transportation Management System (TMS)** to check for available carriers and transit times."
    *   "This 'swivel chair' process is slow, prone to manual error, and provides a fragmented view of reality. When every minute counts, this friction costs you time, money, and potentially, customer satisfaction."

### **Part 2: The Solution - A Digital Teammate for Your Supply Chain (3:00 - 5:00)**

**(Timing: 2 minutes)**

**Talking Points & Key Messages:**

*   **(Slide 3: Introducing IBM watsonx Orchestrate)**
    *   "What if Sarah didn't have to log into three different systems? What if she could just... ask?"
    *   "This is the power of IBM watsonx Orchestrate. It’s not just another dashboard or automation tool. It's an AI-powered digital teammate that understands natural language, connects securely to your existing systems, and takes action on your behalf."
    *   "We see you're already exploring AI with Google's Agent Builder for internal knowledge. That's a great start. Orchestrate takes it a step further by moving from *knowledge retrieval* to complex *action-taking* across your entire operational landscape."

*   **(Slide 4: The Agent Team Architecture)**
    *   "Behind the scenes, we build a team of AI agents that mirror your business functions.
        *   A **Supply Chain Supervisor Agent** acts as the manager. It understands the overall goal.
        *   It then directs tasks to specialized collaborator agents, like an **Inventory Agent** that knows how to talk to your ERP, a **Logistics Agent** connected to your TMS, and a **Reporting Agent** that can summarize data and draft communications."
    *   "This allows you to automate complex, end-to-end processes with simple, conversational requests. Let's see it in action."

### **Part 3: Live Demo Flow (5:00 - 13:00)**

**(Timing: 8 minutes)**

**Demo Environment:** watsonx Orchestrate chat interface.

#### **Scenario 1: The Simple, High-Value Query**

*   **Presenter Action:** Open the watsonx Orchestrate chat.
*   **Talking Points:** "We're now looking at the Orchestrate interface. I'm playing the role of Sarah, the Supply Chain Manager. I'm going to ask the exact question from your use case."
*   **Demo Step 1: User Asks the Question**
    *   **Type into chat:** `What's the current stock of disinfecting wipes at the Atlanta warehouse, and when is the next shipment from the Reno plant scheduled to arrive?`
*   **Talking Points (while the agent works):** "Right now, the Supervisor Agent is breaking down my request. It understands 'stock' means inventory and 'shipment' means logistics. It's dispatching the Inventory Agent to query a simulated ERP for the Atlanta stock levels and the Logistics Agent to query the TMS for the ETA of the Reno shipment."
*   **Demo Step 2: Agent Provides the Answer**
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The agent returns a clean, concise answer in the chat.
        > "There are **150,000 units** of disinfecting wipes currently available at the Atlanta warehouse (ATL-DC-01). The next shipment from the Reno plant (RNO-PL-01), shipment ID #SHP-78921, is scheduled to arrive in Atlanta on **September 14, 2025, at 11:00 AM EST**."
*   **Talking Points:** "And there it is. In seconds, I have a single, trusted answer that previously took 15 minutes and three logins to assemble. This is moving from manual data hunting to immediate, actionable insight."

#### **Scenario 2: The Complex, Proactive Response**

*   **Presenter Action:** Stay in the chat interface.
*   **Talking Points:** "That was powerful, but let's escalate the complexity. Let's say we get an alert about a potential disruption—a major snowstorm is forecast for the Northeast. We need to get ahead of it."
*   **Demo Step 3: User Poses a Complex Task**
    *   **Type into chat:** `There's a stockout risk for Pine-Sol in the Northeast due to a weather alert. Analyze inventory at the Boston and Philly DCs, check all inbound shipments scheduled in the next 48 hours, and draft an email to the regional VPs summarizing the risk and recommending a proactive stock transfer from Philly to Boston.`
*   **Talking Points (while the agent works):** "This is far more than a simple query. This is a multi-step workflow. The agent needs to:
    1.  **Query Inventory:** Hit the ERP twice for two different locations.
    2.  **Query Logistics:** Check the TMS for all inbound shipments to that region.
    3.  **Synthesize:** Analyze the data to confirm the risk.
    4.  **Communicate:** Draft a professional email with the key data points, ready to be sent."
*   **Demo Step 4: Agent Completes the Workflow**
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The agent returns a summary and a fully drafted email.
        > **Summary:**
        > *   **Boston DC:** 5,000 units (Critically Low)
        > *   **Philly DC:** 45,000 units (Sufficient)
        > *   **Inbound Shipments:** 2 shipments to Boston are delayed by an estimated 24-36 hours.
        >
        > **Draft Email:**
        > **To:** Regional VPs
        > **Subject:** Proactive Alert: Pine-Sol Stockout Risk in Northeast
        >
        > Team,
        >
        > Due to the impending weather system, we are facing a high risk of a stockout for Pine-Sol at the Boston DC, which currently holds only 5,000 units. Two inbound shipments are confirmed to be delayed.
        >
        > The Philadelphia DC has a surplus of 45,000 units. I recommend we initiate an emergency stock transfer of 20,000 units from Philly to Boston immediately to mitigate this risk and ensure service levels.
        >
        > Please advise on approval to proceed.
        >
        > Best,
        > Sarah
*   **Talking Points:** "Look at this. The agent didn't just give me data; it performed the analysis, identified the solution, and automated the communication. Sarah is no longer just a data collector; she's a strategic decision-maker. This is how you build resilience."

### **Part 4: Technical Highlights & Business Value (13:00 - 16:00)**

**(Timing: 3 minutes)**

**Talking Points & Key Messages:**

*   **(Slide 5: How We Built This - The ADK)**
    *   "You might be wondering, 'This looks great, but is it hard to build and connect to our systems?' The answer is no, thanks to our Agent Development Kit, or ADK."
    *   "Your developers can use simple Python or OpenAPI specifications to create new tools that securely connect to your existing applications—whether it's SAP, a custom-built WMS, or any other API-enabled system."
    *   **(Show a brief snippet of the `data_ingestion_tools.py` code)** "This is a simple Python function with a decorator. That's all it takes to teach Orchestrate a new skill. It's designed for rapid development and integration, allowing you to start small and scale quickly."

*   **(Slide 6: The ROI of Resilience)**
    *   "Let's tie this back to business value. By implementing watsonx Orchestrate, Clorox can achieve:"
        *   **Drastic Efficiency Gains:** Reduce time spent on manual data aggregation by over 90%, freeing up your supply chain team for higher-value strategic tasks.
        *   **Improved Decision Velocity:** Go from hours to seconds in answering critical operational questions, enabling faster responses to both opportunities and disruptions.
        *   **Enhanced Operational Resilience:** In a crisis like the 2023 cyberattack, having a single interface to query and command systems could be the difference between a controlled response and operational paralysis. It mitigates risk and accelerates recovery.
        *   **Reduced Errors:** Eliminate the human error inherent in manually copying data between siloed systems, ensuring greater accuracy in your planning and execution.

### **Part 5: Q&A and Next Steps (16:00 - 20:00)**

**(Timing: 4 minutes)**

**Talking Points & Key Messages:**

*   "I'll pause here to answer any questions you may have."

**Anticipated Q&A:**

1.  **Q: How does this connect to our specific ERP/WMS/TMS? Are there pre-built connectors?**
    *   **A:** We have a growing library of pre-built connectors for major applications like Salesforce, SAP, and Workday. For custom or specialized systems, the Agent Development Kit (ADK) allows your team to build secure, custom tools using standard OpenAPI specs or Python, giving you full flexibility to connect to any API-enabled platform.

2.  **Q: How do you ensure the security and governance of our sensitive supply chain data?**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. watsonx Orchestrate is built on IBM Cloud, which adheres to the highest security standards. All connections are authenticated and encrypted. Furthermore, you have granular control over which agents can access which tools and data sources, ensuring that users only see and act on the information they are authorized for. It integrates with the watsonx.governance toolkit for full lifecycle governance.

3.  **Q: What does implementation look like? How long until we see value?**
    *   **A:** We recommend a "start small, scale fast" approach. We can work with you to identify a single, high-impact use case—like the inventory check we just demonstrated—and build a proof-of-concept in just a few weeks. You'll see tangible value very quickly before expanding to more complex, end-to-end workflows.

*   **(Slide 7: Next Steps)**
    *   "Thank you for your time and the great questions."
    *   "Our proposed next step is a two-hour discovery workshop with your supply chain and IT stakeholders. The goal would be to map out 1-2 priority use cases and define the scope for a pilot project."
    *   "We want to help you transform your supply chain from a reactive cost center to a proactive, resilient, and strategic asset for Clorox. We're confident that watsonx Orchestrate is the key to unlocking that potential."
