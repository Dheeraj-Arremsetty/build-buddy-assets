### **Section 1: Introduction & The Business Imperative (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. We're here to talk about one of the most significant hidden costs in any enterprise: the productivity tax. It's the time your employees spend searching for internal information and the time your experts, like the HR team, spend answering the same questions over and over."

"At IBM, our entire strategy is focused on helping businesses like yours scale with AI you can trust. As our own research shows, our strength lies in providing enterprise-grade AI for business, built on a hybrid cloud foundation that respects your data, wherever it lives. We don't just build technology; we build solutions for the complex, regulated industries you operate in."

"Today, we're going to focus on how to solve that productivity tax with **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**. This isn't just another chatbot. It's an enterprise platform for building, managing, and scaling a **digital workforce**—AI agents that can not only answer questions but also take action on your behalf."

"Our agenda is simple:
1.  We'll define the specific challenge facing your HR department.
2.  I'll show you how we can build a trusted AI assistant to solve it—live, in just a few minutes.
3.  We'll discuss the immediate business value and how this scales across your organization."

### **Section 2: The HR Productivity Drain: A Common Challenge (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"Let's get specific with a scenario we see constantly. Your HR team is a strategic asset, responsible for talent, culture, and growth. Yet, they spend up to 40% of their time answering repetitive, low-level employee questions."

"The challenges are clear:"

*   **Information Silos:** Policies are buried in PDFs on the intranet, benefits information is on a third-party site, and company guidelines are in a shared drive. Finding a simple answer is a frustrating scavenger hunt for employees.
*   **HR Burnout & Inefficiency:** Your HR professionals are context-switching all day, from a strategic workforce plan to answering a question about vacation policy for the tenth time. This is not a good use of their expertise.
*   **Inconsistent Answers & Compliance Risk:** Different HR members might give slightly different answers. Outdated documents can lead to incorrect information being shared, creating a real compliance risk.
*   **Poor Employee Experience:** New hires and even tenured employees feel frustrated when they can't get immediate, accurate answers to their questions, especially on sensitive topics like benefits or leave.

"This is not just an HR problem; it's a company-wide productivity problem. And it's the perfect problem to solve with a purpose-built AI agent."

### **Section 3: The Solution: Your AI-Powered Digital HR Specialist (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"Imagine giving every single one of your employees a dedicated, 24/7 HR assistant. One that has read every policy document, is always up-to-date, and can provide instant, accurate answers sourced directly from your official materials."

"That's what we're going to build today: an **HR Policy & FAQ Assistant**. This AI agent, built on watsonx Orchestrate, will:"

*   **Understand Natural Language:** Employees can ask questions just like they would ask a person.
*   **Use Your Trusted Data:** It will be grounded exclusively in the knowledge base of HR documents that *you* provide. No making things up, no using public internet data.
*   **Cite Its Sources:** For every answer, it will provide a direct reference to the source document, ensuring complete trust and auditability.
*   **Operate Securely:** It runs within your secure watsonx environment, inheriting all the enterprise-grade security and governance that IBM is known for.

**Business Value Proposition:**

*   **For the Business:** We're going to **reclaim thousands of productivity hours** across the entire organization.
*   **For HR:** We'll **liberate your HR team** to focus on high-value strategic initiatives instead of repetitive support tasks.
*   **For Employees:** We'll deliver a **vastly improved employee experience** with instant, on-demand access to information.

### **Section 4: Live Demo: From Zero to HR Agent (8 minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points & Demo Flow)**

"Talk is cheap, so let's build it. I'm going to show you how simple it is to create this agent using the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK). What you're seeing is not a pre-recorded video; we are building and deploying this live."

**Step 1: The Building Blocks - Giving the Agent Its Knowledge (2 mins)**

"Every agent needs two things: knowledge to reason over, and instructions on how to behave. We'll start with the knowledge."

*   **Action:** Open a project directory with a `documents` folder containing a few sample HR policy PDFs (e.g., `Employee_Handbook_2025.pdf`, `Benefits_Summary.pdf`).
*   **Talking Points:** "Here are our company's official HR documents. This is our 'single source of truth'. We're going to create a **Knowledge Base** in Orchestrate by simply pointing to these files."
*   **Action:** Show the simple YAML file for the knowledge base.
    ```yaml
    # knowledge_base.yaml
    spec_version: v1
    kind: knowledge_base
    name: hr_policy_knowledge_base
    description: Contains official HR policies, benefits info, and employee guidelines.
    documents:
      - "documents/Employee_Handbook_2025.pdf"
      - "documents/Benefits_Summary.pdf"
    ```
*   **Action:** Run the command: `orchestrate knowledge-bases import -f knowledge_base.yaml`
*   **Talking Points:** "And that's it. Orchestrate is now securely ingesting and indexing these documents, making them ready for our agent to use. No complex data pipelines needed."

**Step 2: Creating the Agent Persona (2 mins)**

"Now, let's create our agent and give it a personality and instructions."

*   **Action:** Show the YAML file for the native agent.
    ```yaml
    # hr_agent.yaml
    spec_version: v1
    kind: native
    name: hr_policy_assistant
    description: An AI agent that answers employee questions about HR policies, benefits, and company guidelines by searching internal HR documents.
    instructions: >
      You are an HR Policy Assistant for our company. Your only goal is to answer employee questions based SOLELY on the documents in the provided knowledge base.
      If the answer is not in the documents, state that you do not have the information.
      Always be helpful, professional, and concise. Always cite your sources.
    llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-13b-instruct-v2 # Using a trusted IBM model
    knowledge_base:
      - hr_policy_knowledge_base
    ```
*   **Talking Points:** "This simple file defines everything. We give it a `name`, a `description` so other agents can understand its skills, and most importantly, `instructions`. This is where we control the agent's behavior, ensuring it stays on-task and secure. We then connect it to the knowledge base we just created."
*   **Action:** Run the command: `orchestrate agents import -f hr_agent.yaml`
*   **Talking Points:** "Just like that, our agent is now live and available in watsonx Orchestrate."

**Step 3: Putting the Agent to Work (4 mins)**

"Now for the moment of truth. Let's ask our new digital HR specialist some questions."

*   **Action:** Open the Orchestrate chat interface and select the `hr_policy_assistant`.
*   **Demo Question 1 (Simple Fact Retrieval):**
    *   **User Input:** `How many days of paid time off do new employees get per year?`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The agent provides a direct answer (e.g., "New employees receive 15 days of paid time off per year.") and includes a citation pointing to the `Employee_Handbook_2025.pdf`.
    *   **Talking Points:** "Notice the speed and accuracy. More importantly, notice the citation. This builds immediate trust with the employee. They know the answer is coming from an official source."

*   **Demo Question 2 (Complex Synthesis):**
    *   **User Input:** `What is the company policy on parental leave for a non-birthing partner?`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The agent synthesizes information from different sections of the documents to provide a comprehensive answer (e.g., "Non-birthing partners are eligible for 6 weeks of paid parental leave, which must be taken within the first 12 months of the child's birth. You must submit a request through the HR portal at least 30 days in advance."). It cites the relevant sources.
    *   **Talking Points:** "This is more than a simple keyword search. The agent understood the nuance of the query, found the relevant policies, and synthesized them into a clear, actionable answer. This saves an employee an hour of searching and a call to HR."

*   **Demo Question 3 (Safety & Grounding):**
    *   **User Input:** `What are the best investment funds for my 401k?`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds safely and correctly. (e.g., "I can provide information on the company's 401k matching policy and enrollment process, but I cannot provide financial advice. Please consult a qualified financial advisor.")
    *   **Talking Points:** "This is critically important. Because of our instructions, the agent knows its boundaries. It will not give advice or answer questions outside its designated knowledge. This is a core tenet of IBM's approach to trusted, governed AI."

### **Section 5: Technical Highlights & The Path to Automation (1 minute)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"What we just built is the foundation. This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern, but it's just the start."

*   **The Power of Tools:** The next step is to give this agent **Tools**. We can create a tool that connects to your Workday or ServiceNow API. Now, when an employee asks about leave, the agent can not only provide the policy but ask, "Would you like me to submit a leave request for you?"
*   **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** This HR agent can become a collaborator in a larger digital workforce. An onboarding agent could call our HR agent to get policy info, an IT agent to provision a laptop, and a Finance agent to set up payroll. This is how you scale from single skills to automating entire end-to-end business processes.
*   **Built on watsonx:** All of this is powered by IBM's foundation models and the watsonx data and AI platform, giving you a choice of models, full governance, and the ability to run anywhere.

### **Section 6: Q&A Preparation (Anticipated)**

**(Presenter should be ready for these questions)**

*   **Q1: How difficult is it to connect this to our own systems, like Workday or SAP?**
    *   **A:** It's very straightforward. The ADK allows you to create tools from any REST API using a standard OpenAPI specification or by writing simple Python functions, as you saw in the technical plan. Our consulting team can also help you build these integrations quickly. The value is that you expose only the specific functions you want the AI to have, maintaining tight security.

*   **Q2: How do we ensure data privacy and security with our confidential HR documents?**
    *   **A:** This is paramount to IBM's design. Your documents are ingested into a secure vector database within your private watsonx Orchestrate instance. They are not used to train any base models and are only accessible by the agents you authorize. You have full control and ownership of your data, end-to-end.

*   **Q3: What large language model was that using? Can we use our own?**
    *   **A:** In this demo, we used one of IBM's Granite models, which are designed and indemnified for enterprise use. However, the watsonx platform is open by design. You can easily swap in other models from our partners, open-source models, or even your own fine-tuned models. We give you the choice and flexibility.

*   **Q4: How is this different from a generic ChatGPT wrapper?**
    *   **A:** It's fundamentally different in three ways: **1) Governance:** We are built for the enterprise with auditable, grounded, and secure responses. **2) Action:** Orchestrate is designed to *do things* via tools and APIs, not just chat. **3) Orchestration:** The true power is in creating a team of specialized agents that collaborate to automate complex workflows, which is far beyond the scope of a simple chat interface.

### **Section 7: Next Steps & Call to Action (1 minute)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"What you saw today was a real-world example of how to solve a costly business problem in minutes, not months. We started with a simple but powerful FAQ assistant, and we've shown a clear path to evolving it into a comprehensive digital workforce that automates entire processes."

"The ROI here is clear: every hour your employees save from searching for information and every hour your HR team gets back for strategic work contributes directly to the bottom line and improves your company culture."

"Our next step would be to host a **complimentary discovery workshop** with your HR and IT teams. We can identify the top 3-5 most impactful use cases at your organization and map out a proof-of-concept plan to demonstrate the value with your own data, in your own environment."

"Thank you for your time. I'll now open it up for any further questions."
