# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan for FinCorp Analytics

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building a powerful IBM watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for FinCorp Analytics. The client, a leading financial services firm, faces challenges with its manual, slow, and error-prone process for assessing market risk for new investment products. Data is siloed across market data feeds, internal compliance databases, and economic news sources, leading to inefficiencies and potential oversight.

This demo will construct a multi-agent system that automates the entire "Investment Risk Assessment" workflow. A central `RiskSupervisorAgent` will orchestrate a team of specialized collaborator agents—`MarketDataAgent`, `ComplianceAgent`, and `EconomicAnalysisAgent`—to collect data, perform checks, analyze indicators, and synthesize the findings into a comprehensive risk report. This solution will showcase how watsonx Orchestrate can dramatically improve the speed, accuracy, and auditability of critical financial decision-making processes, directly addressing FinCorp's primary business challenges.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is correctly configured. This is crucial for the successful import and execution of the agents and tools.

1.  **Python Environment**: An installation of Python 3.8 or higher is required.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed. If you haven't installed it, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-sdk
    ```
3.  **Orchestrate CLI Authentication**: You must be logged into your watsonx Orchestrate environment via the CLI. If you have not configured this, follow the official documentation to set up your credentials. You can test your connection with:
    ```bash
    orchestrate whoami
    ```
4.  **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated folder for this demo to keep all files organized. This plan assumes you are running all commands from the root of this directory.

## Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure

A well-organized file structure is essential for managing agents and their associated tools. Create the following directory structure within your main project folder (e.g., `fincorp_demo`). This structure separates agent definitions from tool implementations, making the project scalable and easier to maintain.

```
fincorp_demo/
├── agents/
│   ├── 01_market_data_agent.yaml
│   ├── 02_compliance_agent.yaml
│   ├── 03_economic_analysis_agent.yaml
│   └── 04_risk_supervisor_agent.yaml
├── tools/
│   ├── market_data_tools.py
│   ├── compliance_tools.py
│   ├── economic_analysis_tools.py
│   └── reporting_tools.py
└── requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Create the `requirements.txt` File

This file specifies the Python packages your tools depend on. The ADK will handle installing these dependencies when the tools are imported.

**File:** `requirements.txt`
```
# No external packages are needed for this synthetic data demo.
# If tools were connecting to real APIs, you would add packages like:
# requests
# python-dotenv
```

## Step 3: Develop the Python Tools

The tools are the functional building blocks of the agents, performing specific actions like data retrieval and analysis. Each tool will generate realistic synthetic data to simulate real-world financial systems without requiring live API connections, demonstrating the capabilities of watsonx Orchestrate in a controlled environment.

### 3.1. Market Data Tools

**Business Value:** These tools automate the collection of critical market data, eliminating manual data entry, reducing errors, and ensuring consistency. This frees up financial analysts to focus on interpreting data and making strategic decisions rather than performing tedious data gathering.

**File:** `tools/market_data_tools.py`
```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="get_historical_stock_data", description="Fetches historical stock price and volume data for a given ticker symbol over a specified number of days.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_historical_stock_data(ticker_symbol: str, days: int = 90) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves historical daily price and volume data for a financial instrument.

    This tool simulates fetching data from a market data provider, which is essential for
    calculating volatility, trend analysis, and other quantitative risk metrics.

    Args:
        ticker_symbol (str): The stock ticker symbol to fetch data for (e.g., 'TETF', 'FINCORP').
        days (int): The number of past days of historical data to retrieve. Defaults to 90.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of daily data points. Each point includes
             date, open, high, low, close, and volume. Returns an error message if the
             ticker is not found.
    """
    if not ticker_symbol:
        return json.dumps({"error": "Ticker symbol cannot be empty."})

    historical_data = []
    current_date = datetime.now()
    price = round(random.uniform(100, 500), 2)

    for i in range(days):
        date = (current_date - timedelta(days=i)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        price_change = price * random.uniform(-0.03, 0.03)
        open_price = round(price, 2)
        close_price = round(price + price_change, 2)
        high_price = max(open_price, close_price) + round(random.uniform(0, price * 0.01), 2)
        low_price = min(open_price, close_price) - round(random.uniform(0, price * 0.01), 2)
        volume = random.randint(1_000_000, 10_000_000)
        
        historical_data.append({
            "date": date,
            "open": open_price,
            "high": high_price,
            "low": low_price,
            "close": close_price,
            "volume": volume
        })
        price = close_price
    
    return json.dumps(historical_data, indent=2)

@tool(name="get_volatility_index", description="Fetches the current value and recent trend of a major market volatility index (e.g., VIX).", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_volatility_index(index_name: str = "VIX") -> str:
    """
    Provides the current level of a specified market volatility index.

    High volatility indicates higher market risk and uncertainty. This tool gives a quick
    snapshot of the overall market sentiment, which is a key contextual factor for assessing
    a specific product's risk.

    Args:
        index_name (str): The name of the volatility index to fetch. Defaults to 'VIX'.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string with the index name, current value, and a 30-day trend analysis.
    """
    current_value = round(random.uniform(12.0, 45.0), 2)
    trend_value = round(random.uniform(-5.0, 5.0), 2)
    trend_direction = "up" if trend_value > 0 else "down"

    result = {
        "index_name": index_name,
        "current_value": current_value,
        "30_day_change": trend_value,
        "trend": trend_direction,
        "assessment": "High market uncertainty" if current_value > 25 else "Moderate market stability",
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    return json.dumps(result, indent=2)
```

### 3.2. Compliance Tools

**Business Value:** Automates the critical but often manual process of checking investment products against internal policies and external regulations. This reduces compliance risk, ensures auditability, and accelerates the product approval lifecycle.
