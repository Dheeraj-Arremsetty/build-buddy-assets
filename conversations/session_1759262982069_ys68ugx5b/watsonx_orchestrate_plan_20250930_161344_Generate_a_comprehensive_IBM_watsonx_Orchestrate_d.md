# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Financial Compliance Automation

## Overview
This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building a sophisticated IBM watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for a financial services client. The primary objective is to automate the complex, manual, and error-prone process of transaction monitoring, anomaly detection, and regulatory compliance reporting. By leveraging a multi-agent architecture, this solution transforms the client's current workflow into an intelligent, efficient, and auditable automated process.

The proposed architecture consists of a `ComplianceSupervisorAgent` that orchestrates a team of specialized collaborator agents: `DataIngestionAgent`, `TransactionAnalysisAgent`, `ComplianceCheckAgent`, and `ReportingAgent`. Each agent is equipped with a specific set of tools to perform its function, from collecting raw transaction data to generating draft Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). This plan details the creation of all agents and tools using the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK), providing complete code examples, configuration files, and deployment commands to build a robust and compelling demonstration of enterprise-grade automation.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure your development environment is correctly set up. This is crucial for the successful creation and deployment of the agents and tools.

1.  **Python Environment**: An installation of Python 3.9 or higher is required.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit must be installed. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **Project Directory Structure**: Create a dedicated folder for the demo assets to maintain organization.
    ```bash
    mkdir financial_compliance_demo
    cd financial_compliance_demo
    mkdir agents
    mkdir tools
    ```
4.  **Python Dependencies**: The Python tools will require external libraries. Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your `financial_compliance_demo` directory with the following content.
    ```text
    # requirements.txt
    requests
    python-dotenv
    ```
    Install these dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured with the ADK. Follow the official documentation to log in and set up your environment using the CLI.

## Step 1: Develop the Python Tools
The foundation of our automation is a set of powerful, modular Python tools. Each tool simulates a specific action within the compliance workflow, from data collection to report generation. We will create each tool in its own file within the `tools/` directory.

### 1.1 Data Ingestion Tools

#### `collect_swift_transactions.py`
**Business Value**: This tool simulates the critical first step of the compliance process: gathering raw transaction data from the SWIFT network. By automating this data collection, the client can ensure that all international transactions are captured in near real-time, eliminating manual data entry, reducing the risk of missed transactions, and providing a timely and complete dataset for downstream analysis.

**Technical Implementation**: The tool generates a list of synthetic SWIFT MT103 messages. It uses Python's `random` and `datetime` libraries to create realistic-looking transaction details, including unique IDs, sender/receiver BIC codes, amounts, currencies, and timestamps. This provides a dynamic and varied dataset for each demo run. The output is a JSON-serializable list of dictionaries, a standard format easily consumed by other tools and agents.

```python
# tools/collect_swift_transactions.py
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="collect_swift_transactions", description="Collects recent SWIFT transaction data for analysis.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def collect_swift_transactions(days_ago: int = 1) -> list[dict]:
    """
    Simulates collecting a list of recent SWIFT MT103 transactions from an external system.

    Args:
        days_ago (int): The number of past days to retrieve transactions for. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a SWIFT transaction.
    """
    transactions = []
    countries = ["US", "GB", "DE", "SG", "CH", "AE"]
    banks = ["NWBK", "CITI", "HSBC", "DB", "SCBL"]
    
    for i in range(random.randint(10, 20)):
        sender_country = random.choice(countries)
        receiver_country = random.choice(list(set(countries) - {sender_country}))
        
        transaction = {
            "transaction_id": f"SWFT{random.randint(10000000, 99999999)}",
            "timestamp": (datetime.now() - timedelta(minutes=random.randint(1, days_ago * 1440))).isoformat(),
            "amount": round(random.uniform(5000.0, 150000.0), 2),
            "currency": random.choice(["USD", "EUR", "GBP"]),
            "sender_bic": f"{random.choice(banks)}{sender_country}2LXXX",
            "receiver_bic": f"{random.choice(banks)}{receiver_country}2LXXX",
            "status": "COMPLETED",
            "metadata": {"source": "SWIFT_NETWORK", "message_type": "MT103"}
        }
        transactions.append(transaction)
    return transactions
```

#### `collect_internal_ledger_data.py`
**Business Value**: This tool simulates fetching data from the client's internal accounting and ledger systems. It's crucial for creating a holistic view of financial activity by correlating external transactions (like SWIFT) with internal bookkeeping. This automation bridges data silos, enabling comprehensive analysis and preventing discrepancies that could arise from manual reconciliation.

**Technical Implementation**: Similar to the SWIFT tool, this function generates a list of synthetic internal ledger entries. It includes details like account numbers, transaction types (e.g., deposit, withdrawal), and internal reference IDs. The data structure is designed to be distinct from SWIFT data but relatable, allowing the `process_and_normalize_data` tool to merge them effectively.

```python
# tools/collect_internal_ledger_data.py
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="collect_internal_ledger_data", description="Collects internal ledger transaction data.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def collect_internal_ledger_data(days_ago: int = 1) -> list[dict]:
    """
    Simulates collecting a list of recent transactions from an internal ledger system.

    Args:
        days_ago (int): The number of past days to retrieve transactions for. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, each representing an internal ledger entry.
    """
    ledger_entries = []
    for i in range(random.randint(15, 25)):
        entry = {
            "entry_id": f"LEDG{random.randint(100000, 999999)}",
            "transaction_date": (datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=random.randint(1, days_ago * 24))).isoformat(),
            "debit_account": f"ACC{random.randint(10000, 20000)}",
            "credit_account": f"ACC{random.randint(20001, 30000)}",
            "amount": round(random.uniform(100.0, 75000.0), 2),
            "currency": "USD",
            "description": random.choice(["Invoice Payment", "Service Fee", "Payroll Deposit", "Inter-account Transfer"]),
            "status": "POSTED",
            "metadata": {"source": "INTERNAL_LEDGER", "system": "SAP_FICO"}
        }
        ledger_entries.append(entry)
    return ledger_entries
```

### 1.2 Data Processing Tool

#### `process_and_normalize_data.py`
**Business Value**: This tool addresses the common challenge of disparate data formats. It simulates a data processing pipeline that takes raw data from multiple sources (SWIFT, internal ledgers) and transforms it into a single, standardized format. This automated normalization is essential for accurate analysis, as it ensures all data is comparable and prevents errors that can occur when manually cleaning and merging datasets
