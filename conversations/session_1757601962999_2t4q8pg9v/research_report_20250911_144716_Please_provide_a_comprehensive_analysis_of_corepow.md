### **CorePower Yoga: A Strategic Analysis**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

### **1.0 Executive Summary**

CorePower Yoga (CPY) is the largest operator of yoga studios in the United States, positioning itself as a leader in the premium boutique fitness industry. The company has demonstrated resilience by emerging from a 2020 Chapter 11 bankruptcy, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, to continue its expansion. Its revenue is primarily generated through a tiered membership model for in-studio classes, supplemented by teacher training programs and a growing digital subscription service, "Yoga on Demand."

Strategically, CorePower is currently leveraging Artificial Intelligence for operational efficiency, specifically by deploying a sophisticated AI-powered virtual agent through Google Cloud's Agent Builder to automate customer service. This contrasts with key competitors like Peloton and Alo Moves, which are utilizing AI to directly enhance the user experience through product personalization and performance tracking. This strategic divergence highlights CorePower's current focus on scaling its core business operations efficiently while its digital-first rivals prioritize AI-driven product innovation.

### **2.0 Industry and Market Positioning**

#### **2.1 Primary Industry**

CorePower Yoga operates within the **Health and Fitness Clubs** industry, with a specific focus on the **boutique fitness studio** sub-sector. This segment is characterized by specialized, high-end workout experiences offered at a premium price point compared to traditional, large-scale gyms. CorePower has carved out a niche within the yoga-specific market, which itself is a significant part of the broader wellness economy.

#### **2.2 Market Position and Differentiation**

CorePower Yoga is the undisputed market leader in the U.S. yoga studio landscape by scale, operating over 220 studios across more than 20 states (CorePower Yoga, 2023). Its market position is built on several key differentiators:

*   **Standardized, Athletic Style:** Unlike traditional studios that may vary widely in style, CPY offers a consistent, fitness-centric approach. Its signature heated, high-intensity "power yoga" and "Yoga Sculpt" (yoga with weights) classes appeal to a demographic seeking a physically demanding workout rather than a purely meditative or spiritual practice.
*   **Brand Consistency and Scale:** CPY provides a predictable, high-quality experience across all locations, from studio design to class structure. This consistency, backed by its large national footprint, makes it an accessible and reliable option for consumers, similar to a Starbucks or a SoulCycle in its respective market.
*   **Community and Lifestyle Brand:** The company cultivates a strong sense of community through workshops, events, and its intensive teacher training programs, fostering a loyal customer base that views the brand as a lifestyle choice.

---

### **3.0 Financial Status**

#### **3.1 Financial Health and Ownership**

CorePower Yoga is a privately held company, with a majority stake owned by private equity firm **TSG Consumer Partners**. Its financial history includes a period of significant distress followed by a strong recovery.

*   **2020 Bankruptcy:** The COVID-19 pandemic forced the temporary closure of all its studios, decimating its primary revenue stream. This led the company to file for **Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2020** to restructure its finances and lease agreements (Wall Street Journal, 2020).
*   **Post-Bankruptcy Recovery:** CPY successfully emerged from bankruptcy in late 2020 after restructuring its debt and receiving financial support from its owners. Since then, the company has resumed growth, opening new studios and investing in technology, indicating a return to financial stability.

#### **3.2 Current Challenges**

While the company has recovered, it faces ongoing financial considerations, including navigating class-action lawsuits filed during the pandemic related to membership fee collections after studios were closed (Top Class Actions, 2022). These legal issues represent a lingering financial and reputational challenge from the pandemic era.

---

### **4.0 Revenue Generation**

CorePower Yoga's business model is built on multiple, interconnected income streams that cater to varying levels of customer commitment.

*   **Memberships (Primary Stream):** The core of CPY's revenue is its recurring membership model. The primary offering is the **"All Access Membership,"** which provides unlimited access to all studios nationwide and its digital platform. A lower-priced **"Studio Pass"** offers access to a select group of local studios.
*   **Class Packages and Drop-Ins:** For less frequent visitors, CPY sells packages of 5, 10, or 20 classes, as well as single drop-in classes, at a higher per-class price point.
*   **Teacher Training Programs:** CPY is a major provider of yoga teacher certifications. It offers foundational 200-hour programs and advanced 300-hour programs, which represent a significant, high-margin revenue source.
*   **Digital Subscriptions:** The **"Yoga on Demand"** platform generates recurring revenue through monthly or annual subscriptions, providing access to a library of pre-recorded and live-streamed classes.
*   **Retail and Workshops:** In-studio retail sales of branded apparel, mats, and accessories, along with paid workshops and special events, provide ancillary revenue.

### **5.0 Offerings: Service vs. Digital**

#### **5.1 In-Studio Services (Core Offering)**

The in-person studio experience remains CorePower's central product. Key class formats include:
*   **CorePower Yoga 1 (C1):** An unheated, foundational vinyasa class for beginners.
*   **CorePower Yoga 2 (C2):** The signature class; a heated, athletic, and fast-paced vinyasa flow.
*   **Yoga Sculpt (YS):** A high-intensity fusion of vinyasa yoga, free weights, and cardio, conducted in a heated room.
*   **Hot Power Fusion (HPF):** A blend of hot yoga (static postures) and power vinyasa in a heated, high-humidity environment.

#### **5.2 Digital Products**

CPY's digital offerings are designed to complement the in-studio experience and compete with at-home fitness platforms.
*   **Yoga on Demand (YOD):** A subscription-based digital platform accessible via web and mobile app. It features a large library of pre-recorded classes of varying lengths, styles, and intensities.
*   **Livestream Classes:** A schedule of live classes streamed daily from CPY studios, allowing members to practice in real-time from home.
*   **Mobile App:** Serves as the central hub for members to book in-studio classes, manage their accounts, and access the Yoga on Demand content library.

### **6.0 AI Strategy: Automating Customer Service**

CorePower Yoga's current AI strategy is focused on enhancing **operational efficiency and improving customer experience** through automation. The company partnered with Google Cloud to develop and deploy a sophisticated AI-powered virtual agent using **Agent Builder** (formerly Dialogflow).

#### **6.1 Implementation with Google Cloud's Agent Builder**

The primary goal was to manage the high volume of routine customer inquiries that were straining their support team. The AI agent was designed to handle common questions and tasks, including:
*   Membership inquiries (pricing, freezes, cancellations).
*   Class scheduling and booking information.
*   Finding studio locations and hours.
*   Password resets and account support.

According to a Google Cloud case study, this implementation has been highly successful. The virtual agent now **independently handles over 70% of all customer chat interactions**, providing 24/7 support and freeing up human agents to focus on more complex, high-value issues (Google Cloud, 2023). This application of AI demonstrates a clear ROI by reducing operational costs and improving service availability.

### **7.0 Competitor AI Innovation: A Focus on Personalization**

While CorePower uses AI for customer support, its key competitors in the boutique and digital fitness space are leveraging generative AI to directly enhance their core product offerings, focusing heavily on personalization.

#### **7.1 Peloton**

Peloton is a technology company at its core and uses AI extensively to create a personalized user experience.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** AI algorithms analyze user workout history, stated goals, and performance data to recommend new classes and instructors, driving engagement and retention.
*   **Peloton Guide:** This AI-enabled device uses a camera and machine learning to track user movements, provide real-time feedback on form, and measure progress over time.
*   **Music Integration:** AI helps curate playlists and recommend classes based on a user's musical tastes.

#### **7.2 Alo Moves**

Alo Moves, the digital fitness arm of the apparel brand Alo Yoga, competes directly with CorePower's Yoga on Demand.
*   **AI-Driven Curation:** The platform uses AI to suggest classes and build personalized workout plans based on a user's skill level, preferred styles, and available time. It adapts these recommendations as the user progresses.
*   **Future-Facing Features:** The company is positioned to integrate AI for more advanced features, such as pose recognition and form correction through a user's device camera, similar to Peloton Guide.

#### **7.3 Apple Fitness+**

Apple's fitness service leverages its deep integration with the Apple Watch and machine learning to deliver a highly personalized experience.
*   **Real-Time Data Integration:** AI algorithms use real-time metrics from the Apple Watch (heart rate, calories burned) to display personalized data on-screen and dynamically adjust encouragement during a workout.
*   **Intelligent Suggestions:** The platform's recommendation engine is a core feature, suggesting workouts based on a user's past activity across the entire Apple ecosystem.

### **8.0 Analysis and Conclusion**

CorePower Yoga has successfully navigated significant financial turmoil to solidify its position as the dominant player in the U.S. yoga studio market. Its strategy of providing a consistent, high-intensity product at scale has proven effective.

The company's adoption of AI through Google Cloud's Agent Builder is a pragmatic and effective move to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve customer service scalability. This inward-facing application of AI supports its core business of in-person fitness experiences.

However, the competitive landscape, particularly in digital fitness, is rapidly evolving. Competitors like Peloton and Alo Moves are using AI as a product differentiator, creating "smarter" and more personalized fitness experiences that learn and adapt to the user. CorePower's current operational AI strategy is sound, but to remain competitive in the hybrid fitness world, its future roadmap will likely need to incorporate AI into its digital product itself. The next strategic step would be to leverage its vast user data to personalize class recommendations on its Yoga on Demand platform, thereby bridging the gap between its efficient operations and the product-centric AI innovations of its digital-first rivals.
