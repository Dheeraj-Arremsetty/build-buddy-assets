# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: "Empower" Agent for Employee Success

## 1. Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building and deploying the "Empower" agent, a sophisticated digital assistant for a client in the **Healthcare Administration** sector. The primary business goal is to automate and streamline employee support by creating a multi-agent system that handles inquiries related to healthcare benefits, insurance claims, and IT support ticketing.

The solution architecture consists of a primary supervisor agent, **"Empower"**, which intelligently orchestrates tasks between two specialized collaborator agents:
1.  **Customer Care Agent**: Manages all queries related to healthcare plans, benefits, claims status, and provider searches.
2.  **ServiceNow Agent**: Handles the creation and tracking of IT support incidents for issues that cannot be resolved automatically, such as document generation failures or plan enrollment problems.

This multi-agent system is augmented with a knowledge base containing company FAQs, enabling it to answer policy questions directly. By leveraging a combination of custom tools for data retrieval and action, collaborator agents for specialized reasoning, and a knowledge base for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), this solution will significantly reduce the manual workload on HR and IT support teams, improve employee satisfaction, and provide consistent, accurate information 24/7.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for building, importing, and testing the agents and tools.

*   **Python and pip**: Python version 3.9 or higher is required. `pip` is the package installer for Python and is typically included with Python installations.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: This is the core library and CLI for interacting with the watsonx Orchestrate platform. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate[all]"
    ```
*   **watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. Follow the official documentation to initialize your environment using the CLI. This will connect your local ADK to your Orchestrate instance.
    ```bash
    orchestrate env init
    # Follow the interactive prompts to log in and select your environment
    ```
*   **Text Editor or IDE**: A code editor such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text is recommended for creating and editing the Python and YAML files.
*   **Required Python Libraries**: The tools will use external libraries. These will be listed in a `requirements.txt` file. The primary dependency is `requests` for making HTTP calls.

## 3. Step 1: Project Setup and Directory Structure

A well-organized project structure is essential for managing the various components of your watsonx Orchestrate solution. Create the following directory structure in your local development environment. This separation of concerns makes the project easier to navigate, maintain, and scale.

```bash
mkdir empower_demo
cd empower_demo

mkdir -p agents tools/customer_care tools/service_now knowledge_base/documents

touch requirements.txt
touch agents/service_now_agent.yaml
touch agents/customer_care_agent.yaml
touch agents/empower_agent.yaml
touch tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py
touch tools/customer_care/get_my_claims.py
touch tools/customer_care/search_healthcare_providers.py
touch tools/service_now/create_service_now_incident.py
touch tools/service_now/get_my_service_now_incidents.py
touch knowledge_base/empower_kb.yaml
touch knowledge_base/documents/employee_faqs.txt
```

Your final project structure will look like this:

```
empower_demo/
├── agents/
│   ├── customer_care_agent.yaml
│   ├── empower_agent.yaml
│   └── service_now_agent.yaml
├── knowledge_base/
│   ├── documents/
│   │   └── employee_faqs.txt
│   └── empower_kb.yaml
├── requirements.txt
└── tools/
    ├── customer_care/
    │   ├── get_healthcare_benefits.py
    │   ├── get_my_claims.py
    │   └── search_healthcare_providers.py
    └── service_now/
        ├── create_service_now_incident.py
        └── get_my_service_now_incidents.py
```

## 4. Step 2: Create Python Tools

Tools are the fundamental building blocks that allow agents to interact with external systems and perform actions. We will create five distinct Python-based tools, each serving a specific function within the customer care and ServiceNow domains.

First, create the `requirements.txt` file. This file lists all the Python packages your tools depend on.

**File:** `empower_demo/requirements.txt`
```text
requests
pydantic
```
Install these dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4.1. Customer Care Tools

These tools are designed to fetch healthcare-related information.

#### **get_healthcare_benefits.py**

**Business Value**: This tool provides employees with immediate, self-service access to detailed information about their healthcare plan benefits. It eliminates the need to contact HR for common questions about deductibles, co-pays, and coverage, saving time for both employees and the HR department. The tool ensures that the information provided is consistent and accurate, reducing potential confusion or misinformation.

**Technical Implementation**: This Python function uses the `requests` library to call an external mock API endpoint that returns healthcare benefit data. It accepts a `plan` and an optional `in_network` flag as parameters, allowing for filtered queries. The function is decorated with `@tool`, making it discoverable by the watsonx Orchestrate agent. Pydantic and Python's `Enum` are used for robust type-checking of inputs.

**File:** `empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py`
```python
from enum import Enum
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool
import requests

class Plan(str, Enum):
    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'
    PPO = 'PPO'

@tool
def get_healthcare_benefits(plan: Plan, in_network: bool = None):
    """Retrieves a comprehensive list of health benefits data, organized by coverage type and plan variant.

    This data includes details such as annual deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and various co-pays or
    percentages for medical services under different network plans (HDHP, HDHP Plus, and PPO).

    Args:
        plan (Plan): The plan the user is currently on. Can be one of "HDHP", "HDHP Plus", or "PPO".
        in_network (bool, optional): Whether the user wants coverage for in-network or out-of-network.
            If not provided, both will be returned.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains benefit details for the specified plan.
    """
    try:
        resp = requests.get(
            'https://get-benefits-data.1sqnxi8zv3dh.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/',
            params={
                'plan': plan.value,
                'in_network': in_network
            }
        )
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return resp.json().get('benefits', [])
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"Error fetching healthcare benefits: {e}"
```
**Import Command:**
```bash
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py
```

#### **get_my_claims.py**

**Business Value**: This tool empowers employees to check the status of their medical claims in real-time without HR intervention. By providing direct access to claim details—including status, amounts, and processing dates—it increases transparency and reduces employee anxiety during the often-stressful claims process. This automation frees up HR staff from manually looking up and communicating claim information.

**Technical Implementation**: This function simulates retrieving a user's medical claims. In a real-world scenario, this would connect to a claims processing system via an API. For this demo, it returns a hardcoded list of synthetic claim data, showcasing various statuses (Processed, Pending, Rejected). The `@tool` decorator exposes this function to the agent, and its detailed docstring helps the agent understand when and how to use it.
