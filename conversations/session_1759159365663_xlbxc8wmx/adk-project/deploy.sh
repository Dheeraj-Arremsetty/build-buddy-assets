#!/bin/bash
# Generated deployment script

# Script block 1
pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate[all]"
    ```
*   **watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. Follow the official documentation to initialize your environment using the CLI. This will connect your local ADK to your Orchestrate instance.
    ```bash
    orchestrate env init
    # Follow the interactive prompts to log in and select your environment
    ```
*   **Text Editor or IDE**: A code editor such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text is recommended for creating and editing the Python and YAML files.
*   **Required Python Libraries**: The tools will use external libraries. These will be listed in a `requirements.txt` file. The primary dependency is `requests` for making HTTP calls.

## 3. Step 1: Project Setup and Directory Structure

A well-organized project structure is essential for managing the various components of your watsonx Orchestrate solution. Create the following directory structure in your local development environment. This separation of concerns makes the project easier to navigate, maintain, and scale.

# Script block 2
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py
