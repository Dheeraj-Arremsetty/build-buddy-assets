pip install --upgrade ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
*   **Orchestrate Environment:** You must have an active IBM watsonx Orchestrate environment initialized. If you haven't done so, run the following command and follow the prompts:
    ```bash
    orchestrate env init
    ```
*   **Text Editor/IDE:** A code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for creating and editing Python and YAML files.
*   **Project Directory Structure:** Create a root folder for your project (e.g., `finsecure-demo`) and create the following subdirectories inside it to organize your files:
    ```
    finsecure-demo/
    ├── agents/
    ├── tools/
    └── requirements.txt
    ```

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

This section details the creation of all required components, from the underlying tools that perform actions to the intelligent agents that orchestrate the workflow.

### Step 1: Create Python Tools

The tools are the functional building blocks of the solution. Each tool is a Python function that performs a specific task, such as fetching or processing data. For this demo, we will create tools that generate realistic synthetic data to simulate interactions with FinSecure's internal systems without requiring live connections.

#### **File: `tools/finsecure_tools.py`**

Create a single Python file to house all the tools for simplicity.
