# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Automating Financial Trade Reconciliation for FinSecure

## 1. Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building a powerful IBM watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for **FinSecure**, a financial services client. The primary business challenge at FinSecure is the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of end-of-day trade reconciliation and compliance reporting. This process involves multiple teams and disparate systems, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased regulatory risk.

This demo will construct a multi-agent system that automates the entire workflow. A supervisor agent will orchestrate a team of specialized collaborator agents to ingest trade data, perform reconciliation, conduct compliance and risk analysis, and generate final summary reports. This solution showcases how watsonx Orchestrate can integrate complex business processes, enhance data accuracy, significantly reduce manual effort, and provide a clear, auditable trail for compliance purposes, directly addressing FinSecure's core pain points.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is properly configured. This is essential for the successful creation and deployment of the agents and tools outlined in this plan.

*   **Python:** Ensure Python 3.9 or higher is installed on your system.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK:** The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is the core command-line tool for this project. Install or upgrade it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
*   **Orchestrate Environment:** You must have an active IBM watsonx Orchestrate environment initialized. If you haven't done so, run the following command and follow the prompts:
    ```bash
    orchestrate env init
    ```
*   **Text Editor/IDE:** A code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for creating and editing Python and YAML files.
*   **Project Directory Structure:** Create a root folder for your project (e.g., `finsecure-demo`) and create the following subdirectories inside it to organize your files:
    ```
    finsecure-demo/
    ├── agents/
    ├── tools/
    └── requirements.txt
    ```

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

This section details the creation of all required components, from the underlying tools that perform actions to the intelligent agents that orchestrate the workflow.

### Step 1: Create Python Tools

The tools are the functional building blocks of the solution. Each tool is a Python function that performs a specific task, such as fetching or processing data. For this demo, we will create tools that generate realistic synthetic data to simulate interactions with FinSecure's internal systems without requiring live connections.

#### **File: `tools/finsecure_tools.py`**

Create a single Python file to house all the tools for simplicity.

```python
# tools/finsecure_tools.py

import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

# --- 1. DATA COLLECTION TOOLS ---

@tool(name="collect_trade_data", description="Collects trade execution data from the primary trading system.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def collect_trade_data(trade_date: str) -> str:
    """
    Simulates fetching a list of executed trades from a primary trading system for a specific date.

    Args:
        trade_date (str): The date for which to fetch trades, in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of trade records. Each record includes trade_id, timestamp, security, quantity, price, and status.
    """
    try:
        trades = []
        base_time = datetime.strptime(trade_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
        for i in range(15):
            trade_time = base_time + timedelta(hours=random.randint(9, 16), minutes=random.randint(0, 59))
            trades.append({
                "trade_id": f"T{1001 + i}",
                "timestamp": trade_time.isoformat(),

                "price": round(random.uniform(150.0, 500.0), 2),
                "status": "Executed"
            })
        return json.dumps({"status": "success", "data": trades})
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": str(e)})

@tool(name="collect_counterparty_data", description="Collects trade data from the counterparty confirmation system.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def collect_counterparty_data(trade_date: str) -> str:
    """
    Simulates fetching a list of confirmed trades from a counterparty system for reconciliation.

    Args:
        trade_date (str): The date for which to fetch trades, in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of counterparty trade records. Includes intentional discrepancies for the demo.
    """
    try:
        trades = []
        base_time = datetime.strptime(trade_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
        # Simulate a mostly matching but slightly different dataset
        for i in range(13): # Fewer trades to simulate missing confirmations
            trade_time = base_time + timedelta(hours=random.randint(9, 16), minutes=random.randint(0, 59))
            trades.append({

                "status": "Confirmed"
            })
