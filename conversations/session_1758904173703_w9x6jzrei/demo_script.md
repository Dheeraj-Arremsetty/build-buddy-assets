### **Section 1: Introduction & The 'Global Brew' Challenge (3 minutes)**

**(Presenter on camera, slide with Global Brew logo and title)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Good morning, everyone. It's great to be here today. We at IBM have been following Global Brew's incredible growth story. Your commitment to quality coffee and community is clear, but we also understand that rapid expansion brings significant operational challenges."
*   "Specifically, we want to talk about the backbone of your business: your baristas and the store managers who lead them."
*   "Let's consider the reality for a typical store manager, we'll call him **David**. David is juggling inventory, customer service, and team leadership. With high employee turnover, he's also constantly onboarding new baristas."
*   "Now meet **Chloe**, a new hire on her first week. She's excited but also has dozens of questions:
    *   *'What's the exact dress code again?'*
    *   *'How do I check my health benefits for dental?'*
    *   *'My password for the training portal isn't working.'*"
*   "Every one of these questions pulls David away from running the store. Chloe might get a different answer depending on who she asks, or worse, feel hesitant to ask at all. This leads to a direct business impact."

**(Switch to a slide with three columns: "Manager Burnout," "Inconsistent Onboarding," "Employee Churn")**

*   **The Business Challenge:**
    *   **Manager Burnout:** Managers are spending up to **30% of their time** answering the same repetitive questions instead of focusing on coaching, sales, and customer experience.
    *   **Inconsistent Experience:** New hires receive inconsistent or delayed information, slowing down their time-to-productivity and affecting service quality.
    *   **Early Employee Churn:** A poor onboarding experience is a leading cause of early turnover. For a company like Global Brew, this is a multi-million dollar problem in recruitment and training costs.

*   **Key Message:** The current manual, person-to-person onboarding process doesn't scale. It's straining your most valuable resources—your managers—and impacting your newest employees.

### **Section 2: The Solution: 'BrewBot', Your AI Onboarding Partner (2 minutes)**

**(Switch to a slide showing a phone with a chat interface named "BrewBot," powered by the watsonx Orchestrate logo)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "So, how can we empower both David and Chloe? We'd like to introduce **'BrewBot'**—an AI agent designed specifically for Global Brew's new hires, powered by IBM watsonx Orchestrate."
*   "BrewBot is a 24/7 digital assistant that provides instant, accurate, and personalized answers to new employees' questions. It's a single, trusted source of truth that integrates directly with your existing systems."
*   **Our Value Proposition:**
    *   **For Chloe (the Barista):** Get immediate answers to HR, scheduling, and IT questions, helping you feel confident and productive from day one.
    *   **For David (the Manager):** Reclaim hours in your week. Shift your focus from repetitive administration to high-value coaching and team development.
    *   **For Global Brew (the Business):** Standardize onboarding, reduce support tickets, and improve employee satisfaction and retention.

*   **Key Message:** We aren't replacing the critical human element of management. We are automating the automatable, giving your managers a superpower to focus on what they do best: leading people.

### **Section 3: Live Demo: A New Barista's First Day (8 minutes)**

**(Switch to the live demo screen showing the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface)**

**Presenter:** "Alright, let's see BrewBot in action. I'm going to play the role of Chloe, our new barista, on her first day. She has a few common questions."

**Demo Flow Step 1: Basic Policy Question (RAG)**

*   **Chloe's Prompt:** `What's the dress code policy for baristas?`
*   **Talking Points:** "Chloe's first question is a simple policy lookup. In the past, she'd have to find the employee handbook or ask David. Now, she just asks BrewBot."
*   **Behind the Scenes:** "BrewBot, our supervisor agent, is using its knowledge base, which we've connected to your official HR documents. It's performing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find the precise information and synthesize a clear answer."
*   **Expected Outcome:** BrewBot responds with a concise summary of the dress code (e.g., "You'll need to wear a Global Brew branded shirt, black or khaki pants, and closed-toe, non-slip shoes.") and provides a link to the full document for reference.
*   **Presenter:** "Instant, accurate, and with a source of truth. No more 'I think this is the rule' from a coworker."

**Demo Flow Step 2: Personalized, Data-Driven Inquiry (Tool Use)**

*   **Chloe's Prompt:** `I'm on the PPO plan. What's my coverage for physical therapy?`
*   **Talking Points:** "Now for a more complex question. This isn't something you can find in a static document; it requires accessing structured data. This is where Orchestrate's ability to use **tools** comes into play."
*   **Behind the Scenes:** "Our supervisor agent, `empower_agent`, understands this is a benefits question. It intelligently delegates the task to its collaborator, the `customer_care_agent`. This specialist agent then executes the `get_healthcare_benefits` tool, which is a simple Python function connected to your benefits API, to fetch Chloe's specific plan details."
*   **Expected Outcome:** BrewBot returns a neatly formatted markdown table showing the exact coverage details:
| Coverage | PPO (In-Network) | PPO (Out-of-Network) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Physical Therapy | 90% after deductible | 60% after deductible |
| Annual Deductible | $500 | $1500 |
*   **Presenter:** "Look at that. Not just an answer, but structured, personalized data delivered in seconds. This self-service capability dramatically reduces the burden on your HR team."

**Demo Flow Step 3: Taking Action & System Integration (Multi-Agent Collaboration)**

*   **Chloe's Prompt:** `I can't access my 'Latte Art 101' training module in the learning portal.`
*   **Talking Points:** "Okay, here's a real problem that needs action. Chloe is blocked. Normally, this would mean finding David, who then has to contact IT. It's a chain of delays."
*   **Behind the Scenes:** "BrewBot recognizes this as an IT support issue. The `empower_agent` routes this request to another specialist collaborator, the `service_now_agent`. This agent's job is to interact with your IT ticketing system."
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    1.  **BrewBot:** `I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble. I can open an IT support ticket for you. Can you give me a one-sentence summary of the issue?`
    2.  **Chloe:** `The system says my login is invalid for that specific course.`
    3.  **BrewBot:** `Thank you. I've created IT incident INC0012345 in ServiceNow. Our support team will investigate and get back to you shortly.`
*   **Presenter:** "And just like that, we've gone from providing information to *taking action*. A ticket is created in your system of record without anyone needing to log into ServiceNow. Chloe is unblocked, and David was never interrupted. This is the power of AI-driven automation."

### **Section 4: Under the Hood: The Power of the ADK (2 minutes)**

**(Switch to a simple architectural slide showing Supervisor -> Collaborators -> Tools)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "What you just saw looks like magic, but it's built on a powerful and flexible framework. This is not a black box."
*   **Supervisor Agent (`empower_agent`):** This is BrewBot, the central brain. It understands the user's intent and acts as an "air traffic controller," routing tasks to the right specialist.
*   **Collaborator Agents (`customer_care_agent`, `service_now_agent`):** These are reusable specialists. The `service_now_agent` we used for Chloe could also be used by an agent in your finance department. This modular approach is incredibly efficient.
*   **Tools (Python Functions):** The real work gets done here. The `get_healthcare_benefits` tool is just a simple Python function decorated with `@tool`. Your developers can easily create new tools to connect to any API or system, turning simple code into powerful, AI-callable skills.
*   **The Agent Development Kit (ADK):** All of this is built using our ADK. It's a developer-friendly, command-line interface that allows your team to rapidly build, test, and deploy these agents and tools.

*   **Key Message:** watsonx Orchestrate gives you a composable, enterprise-grade framework to build AI agents that are deeply integrated into your unique business processes.

### **Section 5: Q&A and Common Scenarios (3 minutes)**

**Presenter:** "Before we move to next steps, I want to address a few questions that typically come up."

*   **Q1: How does this connect to our proprietary systems, like our scheduling software?**
    *   **A:** Great question. The ADK allows us to create custom Python-based tools. As long as your system has an API, we can write a simple tool to connect to it, allowing BrewBot to answer questions like, "What's my schedule for next week?"
*   **Q2: How do you ensure the information is secure and personalized?**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. watsonx Orchestrate leverages the authentication of the logged-in user. When Chloe asks about her claims, the tool runs under her credentials, ensuring she only sees her own data. All of this is built on the enterprise-grade security of IBM Cloud.
*   **Q3: How quickly can we get started and see value?**
    *   **A:** We can start small and deliver value fast. A proof-of-concept, like the one you saw today focusing on the top 3-5 onboarding questions, can be built in a matter of weeks, not months. The goal is to solve a real problem quickly and then expand.

### **Section 6: Next Steps & Call to Action (2 minutes)**

**(Switch to a final slide with contact information and next steps)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Today, we've seen how 'BrewBot', powered by watsonx Orchestrate, can transform your onboarding process—freeing up your managers, empowering your new hires, and creating a more efficient, scalable operation for Global Brew."
*   **Recap the ROI:**
    *   **Reduce Manager Admin Time** by up to 10 hours per manager, per week.
    *   **Decrease Time-to-Productivity** for new hires by 25% or more.
    *   **Lower Early-Stage Turnover** by improving the critical first-week experience.
*   **Our Proposed Next Step:**
    *   "We'd like to schedule a **2-hour discovery workshop** with your HR and IT stakeholders. In that session, we will identify the top 10 most common questions your new hires ask and map out the systems we need to connect to. From there, we can build a tailored proof-of-concept and a clear roadmap for a full rollout."

*   "Thank you for your time. I'll open it up for any final questions."
