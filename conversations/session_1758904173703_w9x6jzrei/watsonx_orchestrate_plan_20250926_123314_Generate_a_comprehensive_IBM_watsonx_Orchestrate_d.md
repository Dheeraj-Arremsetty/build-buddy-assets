# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Comprehensive Demo Execution Plan

## Overview

This execution plan provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for creating a comprehensive IBM watsonx Orchestrate demonstration. The plan is tailored to showcase a powerful, real-world use case based on the "Empower: An agent for employee success" scenario. This demo addresses the common enterprise challenge of fragmented employee services by creating a unified, intelligent agent that integrates Human Resources (HR), IT support (via ServiceNow), and healthcare benefits management.

The primary objective is to build a supervisor agent, **`empower_agent`**, that intelligently delegates tasks to two specialized collaborator agents: **`customer_care_agent`** and **`service_now_agent`**. This architecture demonstrates Orchestrate's advanced capabilities in multi-agent collaboration, complex workflow automation, and seamless integration with enterprise systems. By following this plan, you will build and deploy a fully functional agent ecosystem that provides employees with a single, conversational interface to resolve a wide range of inquiries, from checking medical claim statuses to creating IT support incidents.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for the successful development, import, and testing of the agents and tools.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK Installed**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is the core command-line tool for this project. If not already installed, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
2.  **Python Environment**: A working Python environment (version 3.9 or higher) is required to create the custom tools. Ensure `pip` is available for installing dependencies.
3.  **Configured Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. This involves logging in and setting the target namespace for your assets. Use the following command to initialize and configure your environment if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    orchestrate login
    orchestrate env init
    ```
4.  **Project Directory Structure**: To maintain organization, create the following folder structure in your development environment. This plan will assume all commands are run from the `empower-demo` root directory.
    ```
    empower-demo/
    ├── agents/
    │   ├── customer_care_agent.yaml
    │   ├── service_now_agent.yaml
    │   └── empower_agent.yaml
    ├── tools/
    │   ├── customer_care/
    │   │   ├── get_healthcare_benefits.py

    │       └── get_service_now_incident_by_number.py
    └── requirements.txt
    ```

## Step 1: Create Python Tools

Tools are the foundational components that perform actions. We will create two sets of Python-based tools: one for customer care (healthcare) and one for ServiceNow (IT support).

### Customer Care Tools

These tools simulate interactions with a healthcare benefits system.

#### **`get_healthcare_benefits.py`**

This tool retrieves details about different healthcare plans. It demonstrates how Orchestrate can fetch structured data from an API and present it to the user. This is valuable for employees who need to compare plan coverages for specific services or understand their financial responsibilities like deductibles and co-pays.

```python
# tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py
from enum import Enum
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool
import requests # Make sure to add 'requests' to requirements.txt

class Plan(str, Enum):
    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'
    PPO = 'PPO'

@tool
def get_healthcare_benefits(plan: Plan, in_network: bool = None):
    """Retrieves a comprehensive list of health benefits data, organized by coverage type and plan variant.

    This data includes details such as annual deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and various co-pays or
    percentages for medical services under different network plans (HDHP, HDHP Plus, and PPO).

    Args:
        plan (str, optional): The plan the user is currently on. Can be one of "HDHP", "HDHP Plus", or "PPO".
            If not provided, all plans will be returned.
        in_network (bool, optional): Whether the user wants coverage for in-network or out-of-network.
            If not provided, both will be returned.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains benefit details.
    """
    # This is a mock endpoint. In a real scenario, this would be a live API.
    # We use a public mock API for this demo.
    try:
        resp = requests.get(
            'https://get-benefits-data.1sqnxi8zv3dh.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/',
            params={
                'plan': plan,
                'in_network': in_network
            }
        )
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return resp.json()['benefits']
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"Error fetching healthcare benefits: {e}"

```

#### **`get_my_claims.py`**

This tool fetches an employee's medical claims. It showcases Orchestrate's ability to access personalized, sensitive data securely and provide employees with self-service capabilities, reducing the burden on HR staff. The synthetic data includes various statuses (Processed, Pending, Rejected) to demonstrate realistic scenarios.

```python
# tools/customer_care/get_my_claims.py
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool
import datetime
import random

@tool
def get_my_claims() -> list[dict]:
    """Retrieves detailed information about the user's submitted medical claims.

    The details include claim status, submission and processing dates, amounts claimed and approved,
    provider information, and services included in the claims.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, each containing details about a specific claim.
    """
    # In a real application, this would fetch data for the authenticated user.
    # For this demo, we generate realistic synthetic data.
    claims_data = [
        {
            "claimId": "CLM1234567",
            "submittedDate": "2024-05-10",
            "claimStatus": "Processed",
            "processedDate": "2024-05-20",
            "amountClaimed": 150.00,
            "amountApproved": 120.00,
            "provider": "Healthcare Clinic ABC",
            "services": [
                {"serviceId": "SVC001", "description": "General Consultation", "dateOfService": "2024-05-08", "amount": 100.00},
                {"serviceId": "SVC002", "description": "Blood Test", "dateOfService": "2024-05-08", "amount": 50.00}
            ]
        },
        {
            "claimId": "CLM7654321",
            "submittedDate": "2024-06-01",
            "claimStatus": "Pending",
            "processedDate": None,
            "amountClaimed": 300.00,
            "amountApproved": None,
            "provider": "City Health Hospital",
            "services": [
                {"serviceId": "SVC003", "description": "X-ray Imaging", "dateOfService": "2024-05-28
