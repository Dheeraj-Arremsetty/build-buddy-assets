    """Provides a solution for a given error code.

    Args:
        error_code (str): The error code to interpret.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with error description and suggested solution.
    """
    # Simulate error code interpretation
    solutions = {
        "E001": "Restart the device",
        "E002": "Check network connection"
    }
    return {"error_code": error_code, "solution": solutions.get(error_code, "Refer to manual")}
```

### Knowledge Base Tools

#### Article Search
