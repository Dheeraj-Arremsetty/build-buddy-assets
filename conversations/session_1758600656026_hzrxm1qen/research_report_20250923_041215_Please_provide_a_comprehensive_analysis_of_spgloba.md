S&P Global's AI strategy is centered on leveraging its proprietary data to enhance product capabilities, automate workflows, and deliver new, AI-powered insights. This effort is spearheaded by **Kensho Technologies**, its in-house AI and machine learning innovation hub acquired in 2018.

The concept of an **"Agent Builder"** refers to capabilities that enable clients to create customized AI assistants or "agents" tailored to their specific workflows and research needs, ensuring that the AI operates within a secure and relevant data environment.
*   **Data Extraction and Automation:** Kensho's technology is used to transcribe and analyze audio from earnings calls, extract structured data from unstructured documents, and automate the linking of disparate datasets. This drastically improves the speed, scale, and accuracy of data ingestion and analysis.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** AI/ML models are used to develop predictive insights, such as forecasting commodity prices, assessing credit risk, and identifying emerging market trends.
