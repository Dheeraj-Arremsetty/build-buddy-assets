# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: "Empower" Digital Employee Assistant

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building and demonstrating a sophisticated "Empower" Digital Employee Assistant using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. This solution is tailored to address the client's challenge of fragmented employee support systems. Currently, employees face delays and confusion when seeking help for IT, HR, and benefits-related queries, as each requires interacting with a separate system. The "Empower" agent will act as a unified, intelligent front door, seamlessly orchestrating tasks across specialized backend systems.

The proposed architecture features a supervisor agent (`empower_agent`) that intelligently routes employee requests to one of three specialized collaborator agents:
1.  **`service_now_agent`**: An IT support expert for creating and managing ServiceNow incidents.
2.  **`customer_care_agent`**: A benefits specialist capable of answering complex questions about healthcare plans, claims, and providers.
3.  **`knowledge_hr_agent`**: An HR policy expert that uses a knowledge base of internal company documents to provide accurate, grounded answers to policy questions.

This demo will showcase the power of watsonx Orchestrate to create digital labor patterns that automate complex business processes, improve employee experience, and significantly boost operational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is correctly configured.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed and up-to-date.
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
2.  **Authenticated Environment**: You must be logged into your watsonx Orchestrate instance and have an active development environment.
    ```bash
    # Log in to your watsonx Orchestrate instance
    orchestrate login

    # List available environments
    orchestrate env list

    # Activate your development environment (replace <your_env_name>)
    orchestrate env activate <your_env_name>
    ```
3.  **Project Directory Structure**: Create a dedicated folder for this project with a structured layout to organize your files. This is crucial for managing the different components.
    ```bash
    mkdir empower_demo
    cd empower_demo
    mkdir agents
    mkdir tools
    mkdir tools/servicenow
    mkdir tools/customercare
    mkdir knowledge_docs
    ```
4.  **Python Environment**: A working Python 3.9+ environment is required. Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root `empower_demo` directory to manage dependencies.
    ```text
    # empower_demo/requirements.txt
    requests
    pydantic
    ```
    Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Step 1: Create the Tools for Collaborator Agents

Tools are the building blocks that allow agents to perform actions. We will create Python-based tools that generate realistic, synthetic data to simulate interactions with backend systems like ServiceNow and a healthcare benefits portal.

### 1.1. Customer Care Tools

These tools simulate fetching data related to healthcare benefits, claims, and providers.

**File: `tools/customercare/benefits_tools.py`**
This file contains tools for getting plan benefits and checking claim status. The `get_healthcare_benefits` tool provides a detailed breakdown of different insurance plans, allowing employees to compare options. The `get_my_claims` tool generates a realistic list of medical claims, giving employees immediate insight into their status and financial details, reducing calls to the benefits hotline.

```python
# tools/customercare/benefits_tools.py
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional

import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

# --- Tool 1: Get Healthcare Benefits ---

    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'
    PPO = 'PPO'

def get_healthcare_benefits(plan: Plan, in_network: bool = None) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Retrieves a comprehensive list of health benefits data, organized by coverage type and plan variant.

    }
    
    plan_data = all_benefits.get(plan.value, {})
    if not plan_data:
        return [{"error": "Plan not found."}]

    return [{
