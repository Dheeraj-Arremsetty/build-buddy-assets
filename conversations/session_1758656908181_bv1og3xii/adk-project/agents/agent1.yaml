## Step 2: Develop the Python Tools
Tools are the building blocks that allow agents to interact with systems and perform actions. We will create three Python files, each containing tools for a specific recruitment function.

### 2.1 Sourcing Tools
These tools simulate searching for candidates in internal and external systems.

**Business Value**: Automates the time-consuming top-of-funnel activity of finding potential candidates, allowing recruiters to focus on engagement rather than manual searches.
**Technical Implementation**: These Python functions generate realistic, synthetic candidate data, mimicking responses from an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and external job boards.

Create the file `tools/sourcing_tools.py`:
