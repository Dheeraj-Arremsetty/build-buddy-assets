### **Section 2: The Business Challenge: The Data Quality Scale Problem (2 minutes)**

**(Slide 2: The Challenge)**
**Title:** The Data Quality Imperative
**Visual:** An image showing a massive, complex data pipeline with small red flags indicating errors.
**Key Stats on Slide:**
*   Increased Data Volume & Velocity
*   Evolving Business & Regulatory Rules
*   Manual Validation is Slow & Prone to Error
*   Empowering Business Users without Technical Overload

**Talking Points:**

*   "At your scale, maintaining pristine data quality is a monumental task. Your teams of expert data stewards and analysts are your greatest asset, but they are often bogged down by manual, repetitive validation tasks."
*   "Every time a new data source is onboarded, or a business rule for a specific region changes, it creates a new validation challenge. The traditional process of writing tickets for IT, waiting for code changes, and running batch jobs creates a significant lag between data ingestion and its availability for your products like Capital IQ or for your ratings analysts."
*   "This lag introduces risk, slows down innovation, and consumes valuable expert time that could be spent on higher-value analysis."
*   **The Core Problem:** "How can you empower your business users—the data stewards who know the data best—to perform sophisticated, on-demand data quality checks using your unique business rules, without needing to be Python programmers or data engineers?"

**Key Message:** The current process is a bottleneck. We need to move data quality from a reactive, IT-dependent process to a proactive, business-led function powered by AI.

### **Section 3: The Solution: The AI-Powered Data Steward Assistant (2 minutes)**

**(Slide 3: The Solution)**
**Title:** Introducing the AI-Powered Data Steward Assistant
**Visual:** A diagram showing a user conversing with the "Data Steward Supervisor" agent, which then orchestrates tasks between "Ingestion," "Validation," and "Reporting" collaborator agents.

**Talking Points:**

*   "Today, we're going to show you a solution to this exact problem, built on IBM watsonx Orchestrate. We call it the **AI-Powered Data Steward Assistant**."
*   "Imagine giving your data stewards a simple, conversational interface where they can ask complex questions in plain English, like: 'Check this new customer file for missing emails' or 'Validate all phone numbers against our official corporate standard.'"
*   "Behind the scenes, watsonx Orchestrate uses a sophisticated, multi-agent system that we've configured specifically for this use case."
    *   "A **Supervisor Agent** acts as the team lead, understanding the user's request."
    *   It then delegates tasks to specialized **Collaborator Agents**: one for ingesting data, one for applying validation rules, and one for creating clear reports."
*   **Our Value Proposition:** "This isn't just a chatbot. It's a digital team member that automates complex workflows, uses your specific business knowledge to make decisions, and empowers your non-technical teams to maintain data integrity at the speed of business."

**Key Message:** We are moving beyond simple automation to intelligent orchestration, creating a scalable, AI-powered workforce that is customized to your business.

### **Section 4: Live Demonstration (7 minutes)**

**(Live Screen Share of the watsonx Orchestrate Chat Interface)**

**Presenter:** "Alright, let's see this in action. I'm now in the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface, talking directly to our `data_steward_supervisor` agent."

**Demo Flow - Scenario 1: Simple Validation (Finding Missing Data)**

*   **Presenter:** "Let's start with a common, everyday task. A new file of customer records has arrived, and I need to do a quick sanity check for completeness."
*   **Action:** Type the prompt:
    > `In mock_data/customer_records_q3.csv, find all customers with missing email addresses and generate a list.`
*   **Talking Points (while the agent works):**
    *   "First, the Supervisor agent understands it needs to get data. It calls the **Data Ingestion Agent**, which uses its `read_csv_file` tool to load the data."
    *   "Next, the Supervisor knows the core task is validation. It passes the data to the **Data Validation Agent**, which uses a specific tool to check for empty values in the 'Email' column."
    *   "Finally, the Supervisor asks the **Reporting Agent** to format the results into a clean, easy-to-read table."
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent returns a Markdown table showing only the two records with missing emails.
*   **Presenter:** "And just like that, in seconds, I have a precise, actionable list. No manual spreadsheet filtering, no waiting for a batch job. Instant insight."

**Demo Flow - Scenario 2: Knowledge-Based Validation (The "Wow" Moment)**

*   **Presenter:** "That was a simple rule. But what about complex, company-specific rules that change over time? This is where Orchestrate truly shines. We've provided the agent with a knowledge base—a simple PDF document outlining S&P Global's official data standards."
*   **Action:** Type the prompt:
    > `Validate the entire mock_data/customer_records_q3.csv file against our official data quality rules for phone numbers and show me the violators.`
*   **Talking Points (while the agent works):**
    *   "This is a much more complex request. The Supervisor again orchestrates the flow: ingest the data first."
    *   "But this time, when it tasks the **Validation Agent**, the agent doesn't have a hard-coded rule. Instead, its underlying AI model consults the **Knowledge Base**—that PDF of your corporate standards. It learns in real-time that the official format is `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`."
    *   "Armed with this knowledge, it then uses its `verify_against_rules` tool to find every record that *doesn't* match that specific format."
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent returns a report showing the records with invalid phone number formats (e.g., `555-1234`, `123-456-7890`).
*   **Presenter:** "This is incredibly powerful. If your compliance team updates the data standard tomorrow, you don't need a developer. You just update the PDF, and your AI assistant instantly adopts the new rule. This is true business agility."

**Demo Flow - Scenario 3: Interactive Cleansing & Augmentation**

*   **Presenter:** "Finding problems is great, but fixing them is even better. Let's see how the agent can help us with the next step."
*   **Action:** Type a follow-up prompt:
    > `For the records you just found, suggest the correct format for their phone numbers.`
*   **Talking Points (while the agent works):**
    *   "Here, we're leveraging the generative capabilities of the model. The agent isn't just running a tool; it's using its reasoning ability to look at the invalid data and suggest a corrected version based on the rule it learned from the knowledge base."
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds with a list of the invalid records and a "Suggested Fix" column showing the phone numbers in the correct `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` format.
*   **Presenter:** "Now our data steward has not only identified the problem but has a clear path to remediation. We've turned a multi-step, manual process into a simple, two-sentence conversation with an AI assistant. This is how you augment your experts and scale their impact."

### **Section 6: Q&A and Next Steps (2 minutes)**

**(Slide 6: Q&A)**

**Presenter:** "That concludes the demonstration. I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have."

**Prepared Q&A Scenarios:**

*   **Q: How secure is this? Our data is highly sensitive.**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. watsonx is an enterprise-grade platform. You have full control over data residency, the models you use (you can even use your own), and the tools are custom-built Python code running in your environment, ensuring your data never leaves your control for processing.
*   **Q: Can this integrate with our existing systems, like Capital IQ or our internal databases?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely. The Python tools are the integration layer. We can build tools that connect to any system with an API or a database connector. We could create a tool to `validate_against_capital_iq` or `cross-reference_internal_crm`, for instance.
*   **Q: What skills do we need on our team to build and maintain these agents?**
    *   **A:** The beauty of the ADK is that it leverages existing skills. A developer with basic Python knowledge can easily build the tools. The agent configuration is done in simple YAML, making it accessible to a wider team. The goal is to have a small technical team enable a large number of business users.
*   **Q: Can we choose which Large Language Model the agent uses?**
    *   **A:** Yes. watsonx gives you a choice of models, including IBM's Granite series and various open-source models. This allows you to select the best model for the task based on performance, cost, and compliance needs.
