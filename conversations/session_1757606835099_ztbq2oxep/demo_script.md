### **Section 1: Introduction & Business Context (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter on screen or in-person, slide with CorePower Yoga logo and IBM watsonx Orchestrate logo)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Good morning, and thank you for your time. We're here today because we recognize CorePower Yoga as the undisputed market leader in the U.S. yoga studio industry. Your brand is powerful, your community is strong, and your in-studio experience is the gold standard."
*   "Our research highlights your incredible physical footprint—over 220 studios—as your greatest asset. But we also understand that this scale presents a unique challenge: How do you efficiently and consistently onboard the hundreds of new instructors needed to fuel your growth, without slowing down or creating a heavy administrative burden?"
*   "We've seen how your competitors like Peloton and Alo Moves are leveraging AI for personalization. Today, we're not just going to talk about AI in the abstract. We're going to show you a practical, powerful application of AI that solves a core operational challenge for you *right now*: instructor onboarding."
*   **Key Message:** "Our goal is to demonstrate how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can help you close that technology gap, not by changing your core business, but by making it run faster, smarter, and more efficiently."

### **Section 2: The Scaling Challenge: Onboarding as a Bottleneck (3 minutes)**

**(Slide with a simple flow diagram showing the current, manual onboarding process: HR emails, IT tickets, document searches, etc. Highlight pain points like delays, inconsistency, and manual effort.)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Every new studio you open requires a team of highly-trained instructors. The process of getting them from 'new hire' to 'first class' is critical, but it's often fraught with friction."
*   "Right now, a new instructor likely has questions scattered across different documents: an instructor handbook, a benefits guide, IT policies. Who do they ask? Their studio manager? An HR generalist? This leads to inconsistent answers and pulls your skilled people away from high-value work."
*   "When they have a technical issue—say, they can't log into the learning management system—they have to find out how to submit an IT ticket, wait for a response, and experience downtime. It's a frustrating first impression."
*   "This manual, fragmented process creates three key business problems:"
    1.  **Delayed Productivity:** It takes longer for instructors to become fully operational.
    2.  **Administrative Drain:** HR and IT teams spend countless hours answering repetitive questions and processing routine requests.
    3.  **Inconsistent Experience:** The onboarding experience can vary wildly from one location to another, impacting your brand's promise of standardization.

*   **Key Message:** "Onboarding isn't just an HR function; it's a strategic growth enabler. By optimizing it, you directly accelerate your ability to scale."

### **Section 3: The Solution: An AI-Powered Digital Teammate (2 minutes)**

**(Slide showing the watsonx Orchestrate logo and a simple architecture diagram: A central "Concierge" agent talking to two specialist "Collaborator" agents - one for Knowledge, one for Actions.)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Imagine providing every new instructor with a single, 24/7 point of contact—an AI-powered digital teammate that can answer any question and take action on their behalf. That's what we've built for you with IBM watsonx Orchestrate."
*   "We call it the **'Instructor Onboarding Concierge.'** This isn't just a simple chatbot. It's a supervisor agent that understands a request and intelligently delegates it to a team of specialized AI agents working behind the scenes."
*   "For our demo today, the Concierge has two collaborators:"
    1.  **The Knowledge Agent:** It has read and understood all your onboarding documents—the handbook, benefits guide, and IT policies. It's an expert that can answer any policy question instantly.
    2.  **The HR & IT Services Agent:** This agent is equipped with tools to perform actions in your backend systems. It can create an IT ticket or check an HR system, just like a human employee would.
*   **Key Message:** "This is the power of *orchestration*. It's not one AI model trying to do everything. It's a team of specialized AIs, managed by a supervisor, working together to solve complex, multi-step problems."

### **Section 4: Live Demonstration (6 minutes)**

**(Presenter shares their screen showing the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface.)**

**Presenter:** "Alright, let's see this in action. I'm going to play the role of a new instructor on their first day. I'll be interacting with our 'Instructor Onboarding Concierge'."

**Scenario 1: Instant Information Retrieval (The Knowledge Agent)**

*   **Demo Step:** The presenter types the following prompt into the chat:
    > `What is the policy for using personal devices in the classroom?`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent quickly responds with a concise answer synthesized from the mock *Instructor_Handbook.pdf*.
    > *"According to the Instructor Handbook, personal devices should be silenced and stored away during class to maintain a focused environment for members. You may use them for music if it is part of the class format, but personal calls or texts are not permitted."*
*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "Perfect. Notice what just happened. The Concierge agent understood this was a policy question. It didn't guess; it delegated the query to the **Knowledge Agent**."
    *   "That agent performed a search across your documents, found the relevant information, and synthesized a clear, accurate answer. No waiting for an email back from HR. No searching through a 100-page PDF."
    *   **Business Value:** "This provides instant, consistent, and accurate answers 24/7, dramatically reducing the number of repetitive questions going to your HR and operations teams."

**Scenario 2: Automated Task Execution (The HR & IT Services Agent)**

*   **Demo Step:** The presenter types a new prompt into the chat:
    > `I'm trying to complete my training but I can't access the LMS. Can you help me?`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent recognizes the need for action and responds with a confirmation.
    > *"I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble. I can create an IT support ticket for you right now. Successfully created IT support ticket. Your ticket number is INC-84321."*
*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "This is a game-changer. The Concierge identified a technical problem and routed it to the **HR & IT Services Agent**."
    *   "That agent then used its 'Create IT Ticket' tool to automatically log the issue in the helpdesk system. The new instructor didn't need to find a portal or fill out a form; the agent did the work *for them*."
    *   **Business Value:** "This eliminates friction, reduces instructor downtime, and ensures all issues are properly tracked, freeing up your IT team to focus on solving problems instead of logging them."

**Scenario 3: Multi-Step Orchestration (The Supervisor in Action)**

*   **Demo Step:** The presenter types a more complex, two-part prompt:
    > `I read the benefits guide but I'm confused about the HDHP plan. Can you explain it and then check the status of my enrollment? My username is brenda.vance.`
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent handles both parts of the request sequentially.
    > **Response 1:** *[A clear, concise summary of the HDHP plan, sourced from the Benefits Enrollment Guide.]*
    > **Response 2:** *"Now, let me check on your enrollment status for you... According to the HR system, your benefits enrollment status is: Not Started."*
*   **Talking Points:**
    *   "This is where the magic of orchestration truly shines. The Concierge agent broke down a complex request into two distinct tasks."
    *   "First, it sent the 'explain HDHP' part to the **Knowledge Agent** for an expert answer."
    *   "Then, once that was done, it seamlessly delegated the 'check my status' part to the **HR & IT Services Agent**, which queried the mock HR system."
    *   **Key Message:** "It managed a multi-step workflow, using the right specialist for each task, and presented a single, conversational answer to the user. This is how you automate entire business processes, not just simple tasks."

### **Section 5: Business Value & The Path Forward (2 minutes)**

**(Slide summarizing the key ROI points: Speed, Cost, Experience)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "So, what does this mean for CorePower Yoga? Let's bring it back to the business."
    *   **Accelerate Time-to-Productivity:** By providing instant answers and removing roadblocks, you get new instructors ready to teach faster, which means you can staff new studios and generate revenue sooner.
    *   **Reduce Operational Costs:** Imagine freeing up hundreds of hours for your HR and IT staff. This allows them to focus on strategic initiatives—like recruiting top talent or improving IT infrastructure—instead of repetitive administrative tasks.
    *   **Enhance the Employee Experience:** You're providing a modern, seamless, and supportive onboarding experience that reflects your premium brand. This improves instructor satisfaction and retention from day one.
*   "This onboarding assistant is just the beginning. The same Orchestrate platform can be used to build agents that help with class scheduling, member inquiries, studio supply management, and more. It's a scalable foundation for your AI strategy."

### **Section 6: Q&A Preparation (Anticipated Questions)**

**(This section is for the presenter's preparation, not for a slide.)**

*   **Q1: How difficult is this to build and maintain?**
    *   **A:** "It's designed for rapid development. We built this entire solution using the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK). It uses simple YAML files for agent configuration and standard Python for creating custom tools. Your existing development teams can learn this very quickly, and we provide full support and tutorials to get them started."
*   **Q2: How does this integrate with our existing systems, like our HRIS or ServiceNow?**
    *   **A:** "Integration is a core strength. The 'tools' we showed you are essentially API connectors. We can build tools that connect to any system with a modern API, whether it's Workday, ServiceNow, Salesforce, or your own custom applications. The agent orchestrates the work across all of them."
*   **Q3: What about the security of our data? The knowledge base contains sensitive documents.**
    *   **A:** "Security is paramount. watsonx is IBM's enterprise-grade AI platform, built with security and governance at its core. You have full control over the data used for the knowledge base, and the platform ensures that access is secure and auditable. We're not training a public model on your data; we're using a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that securely queries your private documents to generate answers."
*   **Q4: How is this priced?**
    *   **A:** "It's a flexible, consumption-based model. You pay for what you use, which allows you to start small with a use case like this and scale as you see value and expand to other areas of the business."
