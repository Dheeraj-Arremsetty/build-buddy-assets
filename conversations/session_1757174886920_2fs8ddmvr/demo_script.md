## **BUSINESS CHALLENGE** 
*[Duration: 2 minutes]*

### The Current State:
- "Your support teams are handling thousands of repetitive queries daily about printer issues, document management, and basic troubleshooting."

- "Research shows that 70% of these inquiries follow predictable patterns - paper jams, connectivity issues, driver updates, toner replacement."

- "Meanwhile, your highly skilled technicians spend valuable time on these routine tasks instead of complex, revenue-generating activities."

### The Cost of Status Quo:
• Average tier-1 ticket cost: $15-25
• Resolution time: 15-30 minutes
• Customer satisfaction impacted by wait times
• Technical talent underutilized

### Transition:
- "What if we could automate these routine interactions while actually improving customer satisfaction?"
