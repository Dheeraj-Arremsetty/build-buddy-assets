### **IBM watsonx Orchestrate Demo Script: The AI Onboarding Buddy**

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Demo Specialist Name]
**Audience:** Internal IBM HR/IT Stakeholders, or a potential client's business and technical leaders.
**Total Time:** 18 Minutes

### **Section 1: The Modern Onboarding Challenge (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 1: Title Slide - "Reimagining Employee Onboarding with AI Orchestration")**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for your time. Today, we're going to explore how IBM is using its own enterprise-grade AI to solve a challenge that every large organization faces: making employee onboarding seamless, efficient, and engaging."
*   "Let's start with the problem. Onboarding is our first, best chance to make a great impression. Yet, it's often a fragmented experience. New hires are inundated with documents, don't know who to ask for what, and spend their first few weeks navigating complex internal systems instead of preparing to contribute."
*   "This creates friction for the new hire and a significant administrative burden for our HR and IT support teams. They spend countless hours answering the same repetitive questions:
    *   'What’s the dress code for video calls?'
    *   'How do I request my laptop?'
    *   'Can someone explain the health benefit plans to me again?'"
*   "This inefficiency directly impacts a new hire's time-to-productivity and overall satisfaction. We believe there's a better way, powered by AI that works *for* the business."

### **Section 2: The Vision: Your AI-Powered Digital Teammate (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 2: Vision Slide - Graphic of a central AI agent connecting to HR, IT, and Knowledge icons)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Imagine a new hire's experience where, from day one, they have a single, intelligent point of contact—a digital teammate available 24/7. We call it the 'IBM Onboarding Buddy'."
*   "This isn't just a simple FAQ chatbot. It’s an AI agent that can **Understand**, **Reason**, and **Act** on behalf of the employee. Its core purpose is built on three pillars:"
    *   **1. Instant, Trusted Answers:** It provides accurate information sourced directly from our official policies, guides, and internal documents. No more searching, no more outdated information.
    *   **2. Automated Action:** It doesn't just answer questions; it gets things done. It can create IT tickets, initiate HR processes, and connect to the systems your teams already use.
    *   **3. Seamless Orchestration:** Behind the scenes, it intelligently routes tasks to the right specialized systems or agents, whether it's an IT request or a complex benefits inquiry. The employee has one simple conversation; the agent handles all the complexity."
*   "This vision aligns perfectly with IBM's core AI strategy: delivering enterprise-grade, governable, and trusted AI through our watsonx platform. The Onboarding Buddy is a perfect example of this strategy in action, and today, we'll show you exactly how we built it using **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**."

### **Section 3: Live Demo: The Onboarding Buddy in Action (8 Minutes)**

**(Action: Switch to the live demo environment - the `orchestrate chat` command-line interface.)**

**Presenter Note:** "Alright, let's see the Onboarding Buddy live. I'm now in a chat interface, interacting directly with our agent. For this demo, our new hire's employee ID is 'E12345'."

#### **Scenario 1: Simple Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)**
*   **Goal:** Demonstrate the agent's ability to answer questions using its trusted knowledge base.

**Talking Points:**
*   "A new hire's first day. They have a basic, common question. Let's ask it."

    **(Type into chat):** `What is IBM's dress code policy for remote work?`

*   **(Wait for the response.)**

    **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds: `The standard dress code for client-facing video calls is business casual. For internal meetings, the dress code is relaxed.`

*   "Perfect. What just happened here? The Onboarding Buddy didn't guess. It used a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG. It searched its secure knowledge base—which we pre-loaded with the `IBM_Remote_Work_Policy.pdf`—found the relevant passage, and used a powerful watsonx Granite model to generate a clear, natural language answer. This ensures the information is always accurate and governed."

#### **Scenario 2: Task Automation & Collaboration (IT Request)**
*   **Goal:** Show the agent delegating a task to a specialized collaborator agent to perform an action.

**Talking Points:**
*   "Now, let's move from a simple question to an action. The new hire needs their most important tool."

    **(Type into chat):** `I'm ready to start. I need to request my corporate laptop.`

*   **(Wait for the response.)**

    **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds: `Successfully created IT ticket INC... for your request: 'Request corporate laptop'.`

*   "Let's break that down. The Onboarding Buddy recognized that 'requesting a laptop' is an IT task, not a general knowledge question. It didn't try to handle this itself. Instead, it intelligently delegated the task to a specialized collaborator: the `IT_Support_Agent`."
*   "That IT agent then used its specific `create_it_ticket` tool to execute the action, which in a real-world scenario would connect directly to ServiceNow or Jira. The user gets a simple confirmation and a ticket number. This is the power of multi-agent orchestration."

#### **Scenario 3: Complex Inquiry & Multi-Step Action (HR Benefits)**
*   **Goal:** Demonstrate handling a complex query with structured data and a follow-up action.

**Talking Points:**
*   "Finally, let's tackle a more complex, multi-step process that often confuses new hires: benefits enrollment."

    **(Type into chat):** `Can you explain the differences between the PPO and HDHP health plans?`

*   **(Wait for the response.)**

    **Expected Outcome:** The agent provides a formatted comparison (like a markdown table or list) of the two plans, detailing premiums, deductibles, and key features.

*   "This is fantastic. Again, the supervisor agent delegated to the `HR_Benefits_Agent`. This agent's tool, `get_benefit_plan_details`, didn't just return a block of text. It retrieved structured data—a JSON object—with all the plan details. The agent then formatted this complex data into an easy-to-read comparison for the employee, empowering them to make an informed decision."
*   "Now for the final step. The employee has made a choice."

    **(Type into chat):** `Thanks, that's very clear. I'd like to enroll in the PPO plan. My employee ID is E12345.`

*   **(Wait for the response.)**

    **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds: `Enrollment process initiated for plan 'PPO'. Your confirmation number is ENR.... You will receive an email from HR with the next steps.`

*   "And just like that, the first step of a critical onboarding process is complete. The agent used another tool, `initiate_benefits_enrollment`, to kick off the workflow. We've taken a process that could involve multiple emails and portal logins and condensed it into a single, seamless conversation."

**(Action: Switch back to the presentation slides.)**

### **Section 4: How It Works: A Look Under the Hood (3 Minutes)**

**(Slide 3: Code Snippets - Show snippets of the YAML and Python files.)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "What you just saw looks like magic, but it's built on a very straightforward and powerful framework: the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit, or ADK."
*   "We don't code agents from scratch. We *declare* them. On the left, you see the YAML file for our main `Onboarding_Buddy_Agent`. Notice how simple it is. We give it instructions, tell it which **knowledge base** to use for RAG, and most importantly, we list its **collaborators**—the IT and HR agents. This is how we build that supervisor-collaborator model."
*   "On the right is the `IT_Support_Agent` and its Python tool. The agent's instructions are highly focused on its specific job. The tool itself is just a Python function with a simple `@tool` decorator. This makes it incredibly easy for developers to connect an agent's reasoning capabilities to any API or backend system."
*   "This declarative, building-block approach is key. It allows us to create sophisticated, multi-agent solutions that are scalable, maintainable, and transparent. We can easily add new skills, connect new tools, or update the knowledge base without rewriting the entire system."

### **Section 5: The Business Value & ROI (1 Minute)**

**(Slide 4: Business Value - 3 columns: New Hire, Support Teams, The Business)**

**Talking Points:**

*   "So, what does this all mean for the business? The value is clear and impacts multiple levels of the organization."
*   **For the New Hire:**
    *   A modern, frictionless onboarding experience.
    *   Reduced anxiety and faster integration into the company culture.
*   **For HR & IT Support Teams:**
    *   Drastic reduction in repetitive, low-level support queries.
    *   Frees up teams to focus on strategic initiatives and complex, human-centric issues.
*   **For the Business:**
    *   **Faster Time-to-Productivity:** Employees get the tools and information they need on day one.
    *   **Improved Efficiency:** Automation of manual, error-prone administrative tasks.
    *   **Enhanced Employee Retention:** A positive first impression leads to higher long-term engagement.
    *   **Scalable & Consistent Onboarding:** Every new hire gets the same high-quality experience, regardless of location or team.

### **Section 6: Q&A and Next Steps (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 5: Q&A and Next Steps)**

**Presenter Note:** "I'll pause here and open it up for any questions you may have."

**Prepared Q&A Scenarios:**

*   **Q: How difficult is it to connect this to our real systems, like Workday or ServiceNow?**
    *   **A:** It's very straightforward. The Python tools we showed are the integration points. Instead of returning mock data, a developer would simply add the API call to the target system. watsonx Orchestrate handles the security and credential management, making these connections robust and secure.

*   **Q: What about data privacy? The agent is handling sensitive employee information.**
    *   **A:** This is where an enterprise platform like watsonx is critical. The entire solution runs within our secure IBM Cloud environment. The knowledge base is curated from our own internal documents, ensuring no proprietary data is exposed to public models. We have full control over the data, the models, and the logic.

*   **Q: Can we use different AI models?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely. watsonx Orchestrate is model-agnostic. We used IBM's Granite model today, but you can easily swap in other models from the watsonx library or even third-party models. This flexibility allows us to choose the best model for the specific task.

*   **Q: How much development effort is required to build something like this?**
    *   **A:** The beauty of the ADK is its speed. The entire solution we showed you today can be built by a single developer in a matter of days, not weeks or months. The focus is on configuration and integration, not on complex AI programming.

**Call to Action:**

*   "Thank you for the excellent questions. What we've shown today is just the beginning. The same multi-agent orchestration pattern can be applied to countless other use cases across finance, sales, and customer service."
*   "Our next step is to identify the next high-value use case within your department. We'd like to propose a 2-hour workshop with your team to map out a process you'd like to automate. From there, we can rapidly build a proof-of-concept, just like this one, to demonstrate the tangible value for your team."
*   "Thank you for your time."
