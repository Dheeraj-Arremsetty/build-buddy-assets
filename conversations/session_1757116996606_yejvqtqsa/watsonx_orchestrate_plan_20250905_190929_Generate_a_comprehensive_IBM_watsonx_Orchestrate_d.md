# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan

## Overview
This execution plan outlines the steps to develop and demonstrate a multi-agent system for Xerox's printer support using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The solution aims to provide intelligent, automated technical support for Xerox printers, reducing support ticket volume by 40% and improving customer satisfaction. This plan leverages IBM watsonx Orchestrate's capabilities to create a robust AI-powered support system tailored to Xerox's business needs.

## Prerequisites
1. **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: Ensure the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit is installed and configured on your system. This includes setting up the environment for agent and tool development.
2. **Python Environment**: Python 3.8 or later must be installed. Ensure all dependencies are managed using a `requirements.txt` file.
3. **YAML and JSON Editors**: Tools like Visual Studio Code or similar for editing configuration files.
4. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Access to a terminal or command prompt to execute CLI commands for agent and tool importation.

## Step 1: Create YAML Configuration
### Diagnostic Agent Configuration
This agent manages the conversational flow to identify device models and issue types. It uses watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct for smart questioning.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: diagnostic_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: planner
description: >
  An agent designed to manage the conversational flow to diagnose Xerox printer issues.
  It identifies the device model and type of issue using advanced questioning techniques.
instructions: >
  Use tools like diagnostic_questionnaire and visual_aid_fetcher to assist users in diagnosing printer issues.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - diagnostic_questionnaire
  - visual_aid_fetcher
```

### Device Knowledge Agent Configuration
This agent provides model-specific information and troubleshooting steps by utilizing native agent collaboration.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: device_knowledge_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: react
description: >
  Provides model-specific troubleshooting information for Xerox printers.
  Collaborates with other agents to enhance knowledge retrieval.
instructions: >
  Leverage tools such as device_info_retriever and error_code_interpreter for providing accurate information.
collaborators:
  - diagnostic_agent
tools:
  - device_info_retriever
  - error_code_interpreter
```

### Solution Retrieval Agent Configuration
This agent fetches relevant fixes from the knowledge base using watsonx.ai integration.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: solution_retrieval_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  Retrieves and executes solutions for identified printer issues from the knowledge base.
  Integrates with watsonx.ai for enhanced solution retrieval.
instructions: >
  Utilize solution_finder and fix_executor tools to provide immediate fixes to common issues.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - solution_finder
  - fix_executor
```

### Escalation Agent Configuration
Identifies complex issues for human handoff and integrates with the ticketing system for seamless escalation.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: escalation_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: planner
description: >
  Identifies complex printer issues that require human intervention and facilitates seamless escalation.
instructions: >
  Use escalation_tracker and ticket_creator to manage escalations efficiently.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - escalation_tracker
  - ticket_creator
```

## Step 2: Create Tools
### Diagnostic Questionnaire Tool
This tool gathers detailed information from users about their printer issues.

```python
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="diagnostic_questionnaire", description="Gathers detailed information about printer issues", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def diagnostic_questionnaire(input: str) -> dict:
    """Collects user responses to diagnose printer issues."""
    # Simulate data collection
    return {"questionnaire": "Detailed diagnostic data"}
```

### Solution Finder Tool
This tool retrieves solutions from the knowledge base based on identified issues.

```python
@tool(name="solution_finder", description="Finds solutions for identified printer issues", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def solution_finder(issue_id: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves solutions for given issue."""
    # Simulate solution retrieval
    return {"solution": "Step-by-step solution for issue"}
```

### Escalation Tracker Tool
Tracks issues that need escalation to human support.

```python
@tool(name="escalation_tracker", description="Tracks issues for escalation", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def escalation_tracker(issue_id: str) -> bool:
    """Flags issue for human escalation."""
    # Simulate escalation process
    return True
```

## Step 3: Import Tools and Agents
### Import Tools
Use the following command to import tools into the watsonx Orchestrate platform.

```bash
orchestrate tools import -k python -f path_to_tool/diagnostic_questionnaire.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f path_to_tool/solution_finder.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f path_to_tool/escalation_tracker.py
```

### Import Agents
Use the following command to import agents into the watsonx Orchestrate platform.

```bash
orchestrate agents import -f diagnostic_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f device_knowledge_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f solution_retrieval_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f escalation_agent.yaml
```

## Verification
1. **Functional Testing**: Simulate user interactions with the diagnostic agent to ensure it correctly identifies printer models and issues.
2. **Integration Testing**: Verify that all agents collaborate effectively, especially in fetching device-specific information and solutions.
3. **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system responds quickly to user queries and handles multiple simultaneous requests efficiently.

## Troubleshooting
- **Agent Import Errors**: Verify YAML syntax and ensure all required fields are present.
- **Tool Execution Failures**: Check for missing dependencies in `requirements.txt` and ensure all external connections are correctly configured.
- **Collaboration Issues**: Ensure agents have the correct collaborators listed in their configurations.

## Best Practices
- **Maintain Comprehensive Documentation**: Ensure all configurations and code snippets are well-documented for future reference.
- **Ensure Robust Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks in tools to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
- **Adapt to Domain-Specific Needs**: Continuously update agents and tools based on the evolving needs of Xerox's printer support requirements.

By following this execution plan, you will create a comprehensive AI-powered support system tailored to Xerox's business needs, improving customer satisfaction and reducing support ticket volume.
