# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Comprehensive Execution Plan for FinSecure Analytics

## Overview

This execution plan provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for creating a comprehensive watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for **FinSecure Analytics**, a financial services firm specializing in risk management and compliance. The primary business challenge for FinSecure Analytics is the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of monitoring financial transactions, identifying suspicious activities, and generating regulatory audit reports. This demo will showcase how watsonx Orchestrate can automate this entire workflow by implementing a sophisticated multi-agent system.

The proposed solution consists of a supervisor agent, the **Audit Reporting Agent**, which orchestrates three specialized collaborator agents: the **Transaction Data Collector Agent**, the **Risk Analysis Agent**, and the **Compliance Verification Agent**. This architecture demonstrates how Orchestrate can connect to disparate data sources (simulated), apply complex business logic and risk scoring, verify transactions against compliance rules and a knowledge base of internal policies, and finally, synthesize all information into a coherent audit report. This plan provides all necessary code, configuration files, and commands to build and run this powerful, domain-specific demo.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for the successful creation and deployment of the agents and tools outlined in this plan.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed and configured. This is the core toolkit for building, importing, and managing agents.
    *   **Command**:
        ```bash
        pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate"
        ```
2.  **Python Environment**: A Python version of 3.10 or higher is required. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    *   **Command (to create a virtual environment)**:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```
3.  **Orchestrate CLI Login**: You must be logged into your watsonx Orchestrate environment via the CLI.
    *   **Command**:
        ```bash
        orchestrate login
        ```
4.  **Project Directory Structure**: Create a dedicated directory to organize all the demo assets. This structure is essential for the relative paths used in the configuration files.
    *   **Command**:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p finsecure_demo/{agents,tools,knowledge_base/documents}
        ```
    *   **Final Structure**:
        ```
        /finsecure_demo

        |   |-- 01_transaction_data_collector_agent.yaml
        |   |-- 02_risk_analysis_agent.yaml
        |   |-- 03_compliance_verification_agent.yaml
        |   |-- 04_audit_reporting_agent.yaml
        |-- /tools
        |   |-- data_collection_tools.py
        |   |-- risk_analysis_tools.py
        |   |-- compliance_verification_tools.py
        |   |-- reporting_tools.py
        |-- /knowledge_base
        |   |-- aml_policy_kb.yaml
        |   |-- /documents
        |       |-- FinSecure_AML_Policy_Guide.pdf
        |-- requirements.txt
        ```

## Step 1: Create the Knowledge Base

We will begin by creating a knowledge base containing FinSecure Analytics' internal Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies. This allows the `Compliance Verification Agent` to answer questions and validate procedures using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), demonstrating how Orchestrate can be grounded in enterprise-specific knowledge.

### 1.1. Create a Mock Policy Document

First, create a mock PDF document. For this demo, you can create a simple text file and save it as a PDF named `FinSecure_AML_Policy_Guide.pdf` inside the `finsecure_demo/knowledge_base/documents/` directory.

**Content for `FinSecure_AML_Policy_Guide.pdf`:**

> **FinSecure Analytics - Global Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy Guide v2.1**
>
> **1. Transaction Monitoring:** All transactions exceeding $10,000 USD must be flagged for enhanced due diligence. Transactions involving sanctioned jurisdictions require immediate escalation to the Chief Compliance Officer. Sanctioned jurisdictions include North Korea, Iran, and Syria.
>
> **2. Customer Due Diligence (CDD):** Standard CDD must be performed for all new clients. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is required for Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and clients operating in high-risk industries such as casinos or precious metal dealerships.
>
> **3. Sanctions Screening:** All client and transaction counterparties must be screened against the latest OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) and UN sanctions lists on a daily basis. A positive match must result in a frozen transaction and the filing of a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).
>
> **4. Reporting:** Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) must be filed with FinCEN within 30 calendar days of detecting suspicious activity. The report must detail the parties involved, transaction amounts, dates, and a narrative explaining the basis for suspicion.

### 1.2. Create the Knowledge Base YAML Configuration

Next, create the YAML file that defines the knowledge base for Orchestrate. This file points to the document we just created and specifies the embedding model to use for vectorizing the content.

**File:** `finsecure_demo/knowledge_base/aml_policy_kb.yaml`

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: knowledge_base
name: aml_policy_kb
description: >
  Contains the official Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policy documents and regulatory guidelines for FinSecure Analytics. Use this to answer questions about transaction monitoring thresholds, customer due diligence requirements, sanctions screening procedures, and reporting obligations.
documents:
  - "knowledge_base/documents/FinSecure_AML_Policy_Guide.pdf"
vector_index:
  embeddings_model_name: ibm/slate-125m-english-rtrvr-v2
```

## Step 2: Create Python Tools

Now, we will create the Python tools that provide the functional capabilities for our agents. Each tool simulates an interaction with an enterprise system or performs a specific business logic task, generating realistic, synthetic data relevant to the financial compliance domain.

### 2.1. Create `requirements.txt`

Create a file to list the Python dependencies. While our mock tools have minimal dependencies, this is a best practice for any real-world project.

**File:** `finsecure_demo/requirements.txt`
```
requests
python-dotenv
```

### 2.2. Data Collection Tools

These tools simulate fetching raw data from various financial systems, demonstrating Orchestrate's ability to act as a data aggregator.

**File:** `finsecure_demo/tools/data_collection_tools.py`

```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="fetch_swift_transactions", description="Fetches recent international SWIFT transaction records for analysis.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_swift_transactions(limit: int = 5) -> str:
    """
    Simulates fetching a list of recent SWIFT MT103 international payment transactions.

    Args:
        limit (int): The maximum number of transaction records to return. Defaults to 5.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of transaction objects.
    """
    transactions = []
    countries = ["USA", "GBR", "SGP", "CHE", "IRN", "CYM", "NGA"]
    entities = ["Global Trade Corp", "Fintech Innovations LLC", "Offshore Holdings Ltd", "Ali Hassan", "Mega Ventures Inc."]
    for i in range(limit):
        timestamp = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=random.randint(1, 72))
        transactions.append({
            "transaction_id": f"SWIFT_G{random.randint(10000000, 99999999)}",
            "timestamp_utc": timestamp.isoformat(),
            "amount_usd": round(random.uniform(5000.0, 500000.0), 2),
            "sender_bank": f"Bank-{random.choice(['A','B','C'])}",
            "receiver_bank": f"Bank-{random.choice(['X','Y','Z'])}",
            "origin_country": random.choice(countries),
            "destination_country": random.choice(countries),
            "sender_name": random.choice(entities),
            "receiver_name": random.choice(entities)
        })
    return json.dumps(transactions, indent=2)

@tool(name="get_internal_ledger_entries", description="Retrieves internal transaction ledger entries from the core accounting system.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_internal_ledger_entries(account_id: str = "AC-1005") -> str:
    """
    Simulates retrieving internal ledger movements for a specific account.

    Args:
        account_id (str): The account ID to query. Defaults to 'AC-1005'.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list
