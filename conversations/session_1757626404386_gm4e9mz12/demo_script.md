### **I. Opening & Company Context (2 minutes)**

**(Presenter on screen, slide with CorePower Yoga and IBM watsonx Orchestrate logos)**

**Talking Points:**
"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with the IBM watsonx Orchestrate team.

Our goal today is to show you how Orchestrate can become a strategic asset for CorePower Yoga, not just by introducing new technology, but by amplifying the operational excellence that has already made you the undisputed market leader in the U.S. yoga industry.

We've done our homework. We understand your incredible post-pandemic recovery, your strong brand built on consistency and an athletic style, and your unique, forward-thinking AI strategy. While competitors like Peloton and Lululemon focus on customer-facing AI for form correction, you've wisely started by using AI internally—with tools like Vercel's AI Gateway—to streamline your digital development. This shows a mature focus on building a strong, agile foundation.

Today, we're going to show you the next logical step in that journey: moving from optimizing *how you build* digital assets to optimizing *how you run your core business operations*."

**Key Message:** We understand your business, we respect your current strategy, and we are here to show you a natural and powerful evolution of that strategy.

### **II. The Business Challenge: The Hidden Cost of a Scramble (2 minutes)**

**(Slide with a picture of a studio manager looking stressed, phone in hand. Icons representing lost revenue, member dissatisfaction, and admin time.)**

**Talking Points:**
"Every multi-location business like CorePower faces a universal operational challenge: the last-minute scramble.

Imagine it's 5 AM. A Yoga Sculpt instructor for the 6 AM class at your LoDo studio calls out sick. What happens next? A studio manager is woken up and immediately begins a frantic, manual process:
*   They pull up a spreadsheet or contact list of certified instructors.
*   They start texting or calling, one by one, hoping someone is awake, available, and certified for Yoga Sculpt.
*   They cross-reference schedules to make sure they aren't double-booking anyone.
*   If they can't find anyone, they face a tough choice: cancel the class, which leads to lost revenue and frustrated members, or teach it themselves, pulling them away from other critical duties.

This isn't just an inconvenience; it's a hidden operational tax. It costs you time, risks revenue, and impacts both employee and member experience. What if you could automate this entire process, turning minutes of stressful work into seconds of intelligent action?"

**Key Message:** A common operational problem has a significant, measurable negative impact on the business. It's a perfect candidate for intelligent automation.

### **III. The Solution: "Yoga SubConnect" - Your AI-Powered Operations Assistant (3 minutes)**

**(Slide showing a diagram: A central "Supervisor Agent" icon connected to "Schedule Manager Agent," "Teacher Comms Agent," and a "Knowledge Base" icon.)**

**Talking Points:**
"We'd like to introduce 'Yoga SubConnect,' a proof-of-concept we've built on IBM watsonx Orchestrate specifically for CorePower Yoga. Think of it not as a tool, but as a new digital employee—an AI-powered operations assistant.

Here’s how it works. We've built a multi-agent system:

1.  **The SubCoordinator Agent (The Supervisor):** This is the brain of the operation. It's the agent the studio manager talks to in plain English. It understands the request, forms a plan, and delegates tasks.
2.  **The ScheduleManager Agent (The Specialist):** This agent is the expert on your schedule and teacher roster. It knows who is certified for which class, who is available, and how to update the master schedule.
3.  **The TeacherComms Agent (The Messenger):** This agent handles all outbound communication. It knows how to send SMS notifications to teachers.
4.  **The CPY Policy Knowledge Base (The Rulebook):** We've fed your official policy documents into Orchestrate. This allows the agent to answer questions about things like substitute pay rates with 100% accuracy, directly from your trusted sources. This technique is called Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG.

This modular design is key. If you ever want to switch from SMS to a mobile app for notifications, you only update the TeacherComms agent. The rest of the system remains untouched. It’s powerful, flexible, and built to scale."

**Key Message:** Watsonx Orchestrate allows you to build sophisticated, purpose-built AI agents that mirror your real-world business processes, combining task execution with grounded knowledge.

### **IV. Live Demonstration: From Chaos to Coordination (8 minutes)**

**(Presenter switches to a live watsonx Orchestrate chat interface.)**

**Presenter:** "Alright, let's put Yoga SubConnect to the test. I'm now playing the role of the studio manager."

#### **Scenario 1: The "Happy Path" - A Seamless Solution**

**Talking Points:**
"It's that 5 AM emergency. Sarah Johnson, our instructor, just called out. Let's ask the agent for help."

*   **[Presenter types the prompt]:**
    `I need a sub for Sarah's 6 PM C2 class at the LoDo studio for the class at 2024-09-25T18:00:00Z.`

*   **[Presenter narrates the agent's actions as it works]:**
    "Okay, watch what happens. The SubCoordinator agent has received the request.
    1.  First, it delegates to the **ScheduleManager** to find the exact class details. It confirms Class ID C101 is a C2 class taught by Sarah.
    2.  Next, it asks the **ScheduleManager** to find all available teachers with a C2 certification, making sure to exclude Sarah.
    3.  The ScheduleManager returns a list. The Coordinator picks the first one, Jessica Green.
    4.  It now delegates to the **TeacherComms** agent to send a simulated SMS to Jessica.
    5.  The system simulates that Jessica replied 'CONFIRM.'
    6.  Finally, the Coordinator tells the **ScheduleManager** to update the official schedule, replacing Sarah with Jessica. And..."

*   **[Agent displays the final confirmation message]:**
    `Done. Jessica Green will be subbing the C2 class at LoDo scheduled for 2024-09-25T18:00:00Z. The schedule has been updated.`

**Presenter:** "And just like that, in about 15 seconds, a 20-minute manual process is complete. No stress, no frantic calls, and the class is saved."

#### **Scenario 2: Exception Handling - No Availability**

**Talking Points:**
"But what if no one is available? A good assistant doesn't just fail; it escalates intelligently."

*   **[Presenter types the prompt]:**
    `Find a sub for the 5:30 AM Yoga Sculpt class at LoDo today.`

*   **[Presenter narrates]:**
    "The agent follows the same process. It identifies the class and the 'Yoga Sculpt' certification requirement. It queries the ScheduleManager, but this time, the search comes up empty. Michael Brown is certified but isn't available for subbing. Instead of just giving up, look at its response."

*   **[Agent displays the escalation message]:**
    `I could not find any available Yoga Sculpt certified teachers for that time. Would you like me to search for teachers certified in a different format, like C2, who are available?`

**Presenter:** "This is critical. The agent understands the context and offers a logical next step to the human manager, keeping them in control but still doing the heavy lifting."

#### **Scenario 3: RAG in Action - Instant Policy Answers**

**Talking Points:**
"Finally, this isn't just a task-doer. It's a knowledge expert. Let's say I'm a new manager and I'm not sure about the pay rates."

*   **[Presenter types the prompt]:**
    `What is the pay rate for subbing a 75-minute class?`

*   **[Presenter narrates]:**
    "The agent recognizes this isn't a task. It queries the CPY Policy Knowledge Base we uploaded."

*   **[Agent displays the grounded answer]:**
    `According to the policy documents, the pay rate for subbing a 75-minute class is $55.`

**Presenter:** "The key here is the phrase 'According to the policy documents.' This is not a guess from the internet; it's a factual, grounded answer from your own trusted data, ensuring compliance and accuracy."

### **V. How It's Built: The Orchestrate Advantage (2 minutes)**

**(Slide showing two code snippets side-by-side: the `sub_coordinator_agent.yaml` and the `find_available_subs` Python tool.)**

**Talking Points:**
"So, how complex is it to build this digital employee? This is where Orchestrate aligns perfectly with your existing developer philosophy. It’s about empowering teams with simple, declarative tools.

On the left, you see the YAML file for our main agent. It’s not complex code. We're defining its collaborators, connecting it to the knowledge base, and giving it **instructions in plain English**, just like you'd brief a new employee.

On the right is a Python tool. It's a standard Python function with a simple `@tool` decorator. The docstring—the text in triple quotes—is what the AI reads to understand what the tool does, what inputs it needs, and what it returns.

Your teams don't need to be deep AI scientists. If they can write a simple Python function or describe a business process in English, they can build powerful, enterprise-grade AI agents with watsonx Orchestrate."

**Key Message:** Building on Orchestrate is accessible. It uses natural language and simple code, lowering the barrier to creating sophisticated AI-powered automation.

### **VI. Business Value & ROI (2 minutes)**

**(Slide with a clear table summarizing the value propositions.)**

| Business Value | Impact on CorePower Yoga |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Reduced Admin Overhead** | Frees up 15-20 minutes of a Studio Manager's time per incident, allowing them to focus on member experience and team development. |
| **Protected Revenue** | Minimizes class cancellations, directly protecting revenue and preventing member churn associated with service unreliability. |
| **Enhanced Member Experience** | Ensures class consistency and reliability, reinforcing the premium brand promise that members expect from CPY. |
| **Improved Teacher Morale** | Creates a fair, efficient, and low-friction system for finding substitutes, reducing burnout for both managers and instructors. |
| **Operational Agility** | Provides a platform to rapidly automate other manual processes (e.g., new member onboarding, workshop scheduling) across the business. |

**Talking Points:**
"The value of Yoga SubConnect goes far beyond just finding a sub. It’s about transforming your operations. You're reducing administrative waste, protecting revenue, and creating a better experience for the two groups of people who matter most: your members and your teachers. And this is just one process. Imagine scaling this AI-assistant model to other areas of your business."

### **VII. Q&A and Next Steps (1 minute)**

**(Final slide with contact information and a clear Call to Action.)**

**Presenter:** "I'll pause here to answer any questions you might have."

**Anticipated Q&A:**
*   **Q: How does this integrate with our actual scheduling system (e.g., Mindbody, custom API)?**
    *   **A:** Great question. The Python tools we showed are completely flexible. Instead of reading from a local JSON file, we would simply have that function make a secure API call to your existing system. Orchestrate is designed to be the "glue" between your systems, not a replacement for them.
*   **Q: What about security and permissions?**
    *   **A:** Security is paramount. As you saw in the tool's code, we can define permissions (`ToolPermission.ADMIN`). Access to agents and tools is controlled via role-based access control within the IBM Cloud platform, ensuring only authorized users can trigger sensitive actions.
*   **Q: What skills does our team need to build this?**
    *   **A:** The primary skills are understanding your business process and basic Python. The heavy lifting of natural language understanding, planning, and reasoning is handled by the watsonx models underpinning Orchestrate. This fits perfectly with the skills your team already uses for digital development.

**Next Steps & Call to Action:**
"Thank you again for your time. Our proposed next step is a hands-on, half-day workshop. We'll bring our technical experts to work alongside your team to build out the 'Yoga SubConnect' proof-of-concept, connecting it to a staging version of your actual scheduling API. This will allow you to experience the power and simplicity of watsonx Orchestrate firsthand and build a tangible asset for your business.

We're excited about the potential to help CorePower Yoga continue its journey of innovation, and we look forward to partnering with you."
