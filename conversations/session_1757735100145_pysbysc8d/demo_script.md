### **Demo Presentation Script: The S&P Global Credit Intelligence Co-Pilot**

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Demo Specialist Name]
**Audience:** S&P Global Analysts, Product Managers, and IT Leaders
**Time Allotment:** 18 minutes

### **Section 1: The Analyst's Dilemma in a Competitive AI Landscape (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 1: Title Slide - IBM watsonx Orchestrate + S&P Global Logo. "Accelerating Insight with the Credit Intelligence Co-Pilot")**

**Presenter:** "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time. We know that S&P Global stands as a pillar of the financial information industry. You are one of the 'Big Three,' and platforms like Capital IQ Pro are the gold standard for financial professionals worldwide.

Our team has spent time understanding your unique position, even leveraging AI to generate a deep-dive analysis of your business, which I'm sure looks familiar. This research highlighted two key things: your incredible market strength and the intense competitive pressure, especially around AI innovation.

We see competitors like Bloomberg launching financial-specific models like BloombergGPT, aiming to automate the very data analysis that is core to your business.

This creates a critical challenge. Your greatest asset is the expertise of your credit analysts. But how much of their valuable time is spent on the manual, repetitive, and time-consuming task of preliminary research? Sifting through filings, calculating standard ratios, scanning news feeds… this is the necessary groundwork, but it's not where their unique, high-value judgment comes into play.

Every hour an analyst spends aggregating data is an hour they aren't spending on strategic analysis, identifying subtle risks, or forming the nuanced opinions that differentiate S&P Global. The core business challenge is this: **How do you scale expert analysis and empower your teams to move faster without sacrificing quality?**"

### **Section 2: The Solution: A Digital Co-Pilot for Every Analyst (2 Minutes)**

**(Slide 2: Simple graphic showing an Analyst icon collaborating with a watsonx Orchestrate Co-Pilot icon, feeding into a "Credit Report" document)**

**Presenter:** "This is where IBM watsonx Orchestrate comes in. We believe the solution isn't to replace your analysts, but to augment them with a powerful AI assistant—what we call a **Credit Intelligence Co-Pilot**.

Imagine providing every single analyst with a digital partner that’s an expert at data aggregation and synthesis. This Co-Pilot is designed to do one thing exceptionally well: **automate the 80% of preliminary research that is essential but low-value, freeing up your experts to focus on the 20% that requires human judgment and deep expertise.**

Our value proposition is simple and powerful:
*   **Increase Productivity:** We aim to reduce preliminary research time by **30-50%**, allowing analysts to cover more ground and deepen their analysis.
*   **Enhance Consistency:** The Co-Pilot ensures a standardized, high-quality baseline report for every single analysis.
*   **Accelerate Onboarding:** New analysts can get up to speed faster, leveraging the Co-Pilot as a guided research tool.

This isn't just a chatbot. It's a digital team member, built on watsonx Orchestrate, that works securely with your tools, your data, and your workflows. Let me show you what that looks like in practice."

### **Section 3: Live Demo - The Co-Pilot in Action (8 Minutes)**

**(Presenter switches to the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface, showing the "Credit Risk Synthesizer Agent")**

**Presenter:** "Welcome to the interface for our S&P Global Credit Intelligence Co-Pilot. Let's put it to work. I'm going to play the role of a credit analyst, Anna, who has just been assigned a new company to cover: 'Innovatech Solutions'."

#### **Demo Scenario 1: The Comprehensive Report (The "Magic Moment")**

**Presenter:** "Instead of opening a dozen tabs and spreadsheets, Anna's first step is to ask the Co-Pilot for a baseline report."

*   **Action:** Type the prompt: `Generate a preliminary credit risk report for Innovatech Solutions.`

**Presenter:** "Right now, the Co-Pilot is springing into action. It's not just running a simple search. It's orchestrating a multi-step workflow.
1.  First, it's delegating to a specialist agent—the **Financial Data Agent**—to pull key metrics from the company's filings and calculate critical leverage ratios.
2.  Simultaneously, it's tasking another specialist—the **Market Intelligence Agent**—to get a snapshot of the company's public market performance.
3.  Finally, it's using that same Market Intelligence Agent to securely search a knowledge base of recent news articles to understand market sentiment and identify any qualitative risks or opportunities.

It then takes all of this information and synthesizes it into a single, coherent report."

*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent returns a well-formatted markdown report.

**Presenter:** "And here we have it. In under a minute, we have a structured preliminary report.
*   **(Pointing to the screen)** We have a **Financial Health Analysis** with key ratios like Debt-to-EBITDA already calculated. No manual spreadsheet work.
*   We have the **Market Position**, showing its current valuation and stock performance.
*   And critically, under **Qualitative Risk Factors**, it has analyzed recent news and found a key development: the successful launch of their new 'Nexus' AI platform, which analysts predict will boost revenue.

This entire report is now the starting point for Anna's deep analysis, saving her hours of work."

#### **Demo Scenario 2: The Specific Question (The "Precision Moment")**

**Presenter:** "Now, let's say Anna is in a meeting and needs a quick fact-check on a different company, 'Global Logistics Corp'."

*   **Action:** Type the prompt: `What is the debt-to-EBITDA ratio for Global Logistics Corp?`

**Presenter:** "The Co-Pilot is smart enough to know this is a purely quantitative question. It doesn't need to run the full workflow. It routes the request directly to the Financial Data Agent, which uses its `calculate_key_ratios` tool and returns the answer immediately."

*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds with a direct answer: "The debt-to-EBITDA ratio for Global Logistics Corp is 4.72."

**Presenter:** "Clean, fast, and accurate. This is about getting analysts the precise information they need, right when they need it."

#### **Demo Scenario 3: The Qualitative Insight (The "Beyond the Numbers Moment")**

**Presenter:** "But credit risk is about more than just the numbers. What's the story behind them? Let's ask about the same company."

*   **Action:** Type the prompt: `Summarize recent news and market sentiment for Global Logistics Corp.`

**Presenter:** "Here, the Co-Pilot is leveraging a powerful capability called Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG. It's securely searching its knowledge base—which could be your internal reports or curated news feeds—and *reading* the content to provide a meaningful summary."

*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent provides a summary of the negative news article.

**Presenter:** "And here's the context. It found an article about a major supply chain disruption due to a port strike. It notes the expected impact on earnings and the cautious analyst sentiment. This is a critical piece of qualitative risk that might have been missed in a purely quantitative review. The Co-Pilot found it, summarized it, and flagged it for the analyst.

This combination of quantitative precision and qualitative insight is what makes this Co-Pilot a true game-changer for your workflow."

### **Section 4: Under the Hood: Built for the Enterprise with Orchestrate (3 Minutes)**

**(Slide 3: A clear, simple diagram of the Supervisor/Collaborator Architecture from the Execution Plan)**

**Presenter:** "So, what you just saw wasn't a single, monolithic AI model. It was a team of AI agents working together, and this is the power of the watsonx Orchestrate platform.

At the top, we have the **Credit Risk Synthesizer Agent**. Think of this as the 'Team Lead'. It's the one I was talking to. Its job is to understand my goal and delegate tasks.

It delegates to two 'Specialists':
1.  The **Financial Data Agent**: A number-cruncher. It has tools to connect to financial data sources and perform calculations.
2.  The **Market Intelligence Agent**: The market watcher. It has tools to get stock data and, crucially, it's connected to a **Knowledge Base** of news articles it can read and reason over.

This modular approach is the key. You're not building from scratch. You're composing a team of AI agents using simple Python for the tools and YAML configuration files to define the agents' roles and instructions. This makes the system incredibly flexible, maintainable, and easy to adapt to new workflows. It's designed for your developers to build and for your business to trust."

### **Section 5: Q&A and Your Path Forward (3 Minutes)**

**(Slide 4: Key Business Value & Next Steps)**

**Presenter:** "Before I open it up for questions, I want to reiterate the business value here. We are talking about fundamentally changing the economics of analysis at S&P Global by:
*   **Boosting Analyst Productivity:** More time on high-value judgment, less on low-value data collection.
*   **Improving Risk Detection:** Combining quantitative and qualitative data to surface insights faster.
*   **Creating a Competitive Moat:** Building a proprietary AI capability that leverages your unique data and expertise.

With that, I'm happy to take any questions you may have."

---

#### **Prepared Q&A Scenarios:**

*   **Q1: How does this connect to our live, proprietary data sources like Capital IQ Pro?**
    *   **A:** "Great question. The Python tools used by the agents are completely customizable. We would simply write a tool that calls the Capital IQ Pro API instead of our mock data file. The agent's logic remains the same; it just gets its data from your trusted source. This ensures the Co-Pilot is always working with your real-time, proprietary data."

*   **Q2: How do you ensure the security and privacy of our sensitive financial data?**
    *   **A:** "Security is paramount. Watsonx Orchestrate can be deployed within your secure VPC or even on-premise, ensuring your data never leaves your control. Furthermore, all interactions can be monitored and audited through our companion platform, watsonx.governance, to ensure transparency and compliance."

*   **Q3: Our credit reports have a very specific format. How customizable is the output?**
    *   **A:** "It's highly customizable. The final synthesis step is controlled by the instructions given to the main 'Supervisor' agent. We can instruct it to format the output in any way you need—specific section headers, bullet points, tables, or even to populate a template. We would simply update its instructions in the YAML file."

*   **Q4: What is the level of effort for our teams to build and maintain something like this?**
    *   **A:** "The beauty of the Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) is that it's built on Python and YAML—skills your developers already have. The focus is on defining the logic and workflow, not on complex AI model training. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry and allows for rapid prototyping and iteration."

#### **Next Steps & Call to Action**

**Presenter:** "Thank you for the excellent questions. As a next step, we propose a collaborative, hands-on workshop with a few of your analysts and developers. Together, we can map out a specific workflow—perhaps for a particular industry vertical or report type—and build a targeted Proof of Concept.

Our goal is to demonstrate tangible value for S&P Global quickly, proving how this Co-Pilot can become an indispensable tool for your teams and a key driver of your AI strategy. Thank you for your time."
