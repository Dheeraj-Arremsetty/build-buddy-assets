# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Orchestrated Retail Operations Co-pilot

## 1. Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building the **Orchestrated Retail Operations Co-pilot**, a multi-agent Proof of Concept (POC) for your retail client. This solution is specifically designed to address the client's primary business challenge: empowering store managers by significantly reducing their administrative workload. By creating an intelligent, conversational assistant, we will automate routine information retrieval and task execution, aiming to increase manager efficiency by 30-50%.

The architecture leverages a sophisticated **supervisor-collaborator agent pattern**. A central `retail_copilot_agent` acts as the supervisor, intelligently understanding the store manager's natural language requests and routing them to the appropriate specialized collaborator agent. These collaborators—`operations_agent`, `hr_agent`, and `inventory_agent`—are experts in their respective domains, equipped with specific tools to interact with mock backend systems. This plan details the creation of all agents, their underlying Python tools with realistic synthetic data, and the deployment process using the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is correctly configured.

*   **Python Environment**: Python 3.10 or later installed.
*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit must be installed and configured. If not installed, run:
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate"
    ```
*   **Orchestrate Authentication**: You must be logged into your watsonx Orchestrate environment.
    ```bash
    # Login to your Orchestrate instance
    orchestrate login

    # Set the active environment for your project
    orchestrate env set <your_environment_name>
    ```
*   **Project Directory**: Create a dedicated directory to organize all project files.

## 3. Project Structure

A well-organized project structure is crucial for managing the different components of the multi-agent system. Create the following directory and file structure:

```
retail_copilot_demo/
├── agents/
│   ├── 01_hr_agent.yaml
│   ├── 02_inventory_agent.yaml
│   ├── 03_operations_agent.yaml
│   └── 04_retail_copilot_agent.yaml
├── tools/
│   ├── hr_tools.py
│   ├── inventory_tools.py
│   └── operations_tools.py
└── requirements.txt
```

## 4. Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 4.1: Create the Python Tools

Tools are the foundational components that allow agents to perform actions. We will create a set of Python functions, decorated with `@tool`, that simulate interactions with retail systems by generating realistic synthetic data.

#### A. HR Tools (`tools/hr_tools.py`)

These tools manage employee-related tasks such as scheduling and payroll, directly addressing common HR queries from a store manager. This automates time-consuming lookups, allowing managers to quickly resolve staffing issues and answer employee questions without navigating complex HR software.

```python
# tools/hr_tools.py
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import random
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="lookup_employee_schedule", description="Retrieves the weekly work schedule for a specific employee.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def lookup_employee_schedule(employee_name: str) -> str:
    """
    Looks up and returns the 7-day work schedule for a given employee.

    Args:
        employee_name (str): The full name of the employee to look up (e.g., 'Jane Doe').

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing the employee's schedule for the next 7 days, or a not-found message.
    """
    employees = {
        "jane doe": {
            "id": "E1001",
            "schedule": {
                (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=i)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'): {
                    "start": "09:00", "end": "17:00", "role": "Cashier"
                } if i % 2 == 0 else "Off" for i in range(7)
            }
        },
        "john smith": {
            "id": "E1002",
            "schedule": {
                (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=i)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'): {
                    "start": "14:00", "end": "22:00", "role": "Stocker"
                } if i % 2 != 0 else "Off" for i in range(7)
            }
        }
    }
    
    schedule_info = employees.get(employee_name.lower())
    if not schedule_info:
        return json.dumps({"error": f"Employee '{employee_name}' not found."})
        
    return json.dumps({
        "employee_name": employee_name,
        "schedule": schedule_info["schedule"]
    })

@tool(name="request_shift_change", description="Submits a request for an employee to change their shift.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def request_shift_change(employee_name: str, shift_date: str, new_start_time: str, new_end_time: str) -> str:
    """
    Submits a shift change request into the HR system for approval.

    Args:
        employee_name (str): The name of the employee requesting the change.
        shift_date (str): The date of the shift to change (YYYY-MM-DD).
        new_start_time (str): The requested new start time (HH:MM).
        new_end_time (str): The requested new end time (HH:MM).

    Returns:
        str
