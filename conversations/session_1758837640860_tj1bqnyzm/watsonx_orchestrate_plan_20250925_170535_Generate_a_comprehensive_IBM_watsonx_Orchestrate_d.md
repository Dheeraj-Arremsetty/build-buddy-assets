# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan for FinSecure Capital

## Overview
This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building a watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored for **FinSecure Capital**, a financial services client. The primary business challenge addressed is the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of generating quarterly regulatory compliance reports. The current workflow involves multiple teams manually aggregating transaction data, cross-referencing it against complex regulatory rules, identifying potential compliance breaches, and compiling a final report for auditors.

This demo will showcase an AI-powered workforce built on watsonx Orchestrate that automates this entire process. We will construct a multi-agent system where a `Compliance Supervisor Agent` orchestrates a team of specialized collaborator agents—`Data Aggregator`, `Risk Analysis`, and `Report Generation`—to perform the end-to-end workflow. This solution will dramatically reduce report generation time, improve accuracy by eliminating manual errors, and provide a clear, auditable trail of the compliance verification process, directly addressing FinSecure Capital's core operational pain points.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure your environment is properly configured. This is essential for the successful creation, import, and execution of the agents and tools.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed and configured. Follow the official documentation for installation instructions.
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
2.  **Python Environment**: A Python 3.9+ environment is required. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv orchestrate-demo-env
    source orchestrate-demo-env/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Project Directory Structure**: Create a structured directory to organize all artifacts for the demo.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p finsecure_demo/{agents,tools,knowledge_base/docs}
    cd finsecure_demo
    ```
4.  **Required Python Packages**: Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your `finsecure_demo` directory. This demo will use the `requests` library for potential future API calls, though the mock data is self-contained.
    ```text
    # requirements.txt
    requests
    ```
    Install the requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Orchestrate CLI Login**: Ensure you are logged into your watsonx Orchestrate environment via the CLI.
    ```bash
    orchestrate login
    ```

## Step 1: Create the Knowledge Base
To ground the `Risk Analysis Agent` in FinSecure Capital's specific compliance landscape, we will create a knowledge base. This will contain mock regulatory documents and internal policy guidelines, allowing the agent to perform more accurate, context-aware analysis.

### 1.1. Create Mock Documents
Create two text files inside the `knowledge_base/docs/` directory.

**`knowledge_base/docs/internal_policy_v1.txt`**:
```text
FinSecure Capital Internal Compliance Policy v1.2

Section 1: Transaction Monitoring
- All transactions exceeding $10,000 USD must be flagged for review.
- Any series of transactions from a single account totaling over $25,000 USD within a 30-day period requires enhanced due diligence.

Section 2: Prohibited Jurisdictions
- No transactions are permitted with entities based in the following jurisdictions: Northland, Westria.

Section 3: High-Risk Industries
- Transactions involving entities in the 'Precious Metals Trading' and 'Online Gambling' sectors require an additional layer of verification.
```

**`knowledge_base/docs/regulatory_bulletin_2024_q3.txt`**:
```text
Global Financial Authority - Regulatory Bulletin - 2024 Q3

Subject: Updated Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directives

- The individual transaction reporting threshold remains at $10,000 USD.
- A new watchlist entity has been added: 'Shadow Syndicate Inc.'. All financial institutions must immediately cease business with this entity.
- The use of anonymizing crypto-mixers for corporate transactions is now strictly prohibited and must be reported.
```

### 1.2. Create Knowledge Base YAML Configuration
Create the following YAML file to define the knowledge base. This configuration points to the documents we just created and uses a default watsonx embedding model.

**`knowledge_base/compliance_kb.yaml`**:
```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: knowledge_base 
name: finsecure_compliance_kb
description: >
   Contains FinSecure Capital's internal compliance policies and external regulatory bulletins. 
   This knowledge is essential for verifying transaction compliance, identifying risks based on 
   jurisdiction and industry, and checking against official watchlists.
documents:
   - "docs/internal_policy_v1.txt"
   - "docs/regulatory_bulletin_2024_q3.txt"
vector_index:
   embeddings_model_name: ibm/slate-125m-english-rtrvr-v2
```

## Step 2: Create the Tools
We will now create the Python-based tools that provide the functional capabilities for our agents. Each tool is a Python function decorated with `@tool` and includes a detailed docstring that Orchestrate uses to understand its purpose. The tools will generate realistic, synthetic financial data for a robust demo.

### 2.1. Data Aggregator Tools
These tools are responsible for collecting raw data. Create a file named `tools/data_aggregator_tools.py`.

**`tools/data_aggregator_tools.py`**:
```python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="fetch_trade_data", description="Fetches recent trade transaction data for a given time period.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_trade_data(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves a list of trade transactions within a specified date range. This tool simulates
    accessing a core banking or trading platform to collect raw data for compliance analysis.

    Args:
        start_date (str): The start date of the reporting period in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
        end_date (str): The end date of the reporting period in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of trade transactions. Each transaction includes
             an ID, timestamp, amount, currency, counterparty, and jurisdiction.
    """
    try:
        # Generate realistic synthetic data
        transactions = []
        counterparties = ["Global Exports LLC", "Tech Innovators Inc.", "Shadow Syndicate Inc.", "Quantum Solutions"]
        jurisdictions = ["USA", "UK", "Northland", "Singapore"]
        for i in range(15):
            tx_date = datetime.strptime(start_date, '%Y-%m-%d') + timedelta(days=random.randint(0, 90))
            transactions.append({
                "transaction_id": f"TRD{random.randint(10000, 99999)}",
                "timestamp": tx_date.isoformat(),
                "amount": round(random.uniform(500.0, 25000.0), 2),
                "currency": "USD",

            })
        
        # Add a specific high-value transaction for testing
        transactions.append({
            "transaction_id": "TRD11223",
            "timestamp": (datetime.strptime(start_date, '%Y-%m-%d') + timedelta(days=10)).isoformat(),
            "amount": 15000.00,
            "currency": "USD",
            "counterparty": "Global Exports LLC",
            "jurisdiction": "USA",
            "status": "completed"
        })

        return json.dumps({"status": "success", "data": transactions})
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": str(e)})

@tool(name="fetch_account_metadata", description="Fetches metadata for accounts involved in transactions.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_account_metadata(account_ids: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves metadata for a list of account IDs, such as the associated industry and risk rating.
    This simulates querying a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or account management system.

    Args:
        account_ids (list[str]): A list of account IDs to retrieve metadata for.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing a dictionary where keys are account IDs and values are
             their associated metadata, including industry and risk score.
    """
    try:
        metadata = {}
        industries = ["Manufacturing", "Technology", "Precious Metals Trading", "Logistics", "Online Gambling"]
        for acc_id in account_ids:
            metadata[acc_id] = {
                "industry": random.choice(industries),
                "risk_rating": random.choice(["Low", "Medium", "High"]),
                "onboarding_date": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=random.randint(100, 1000))).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
            }
        return json.dumps({"status": "success", "data": metadata})
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": str(e)})
```

### 2.2. Risk Analysis Tools
These tools perform the core compliance checks. Create a file named `tools/risk_analysis_tools.py`.

**`tools/risk_analysis_tools.py`**:
```python
import json
import random
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="analyze_transaction_patterns", description="Analyzes transaction data to identify suspicious patterns and flags potential compliance issues.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def analyze_transaction_patterns(transactions_json: str) -> str:
    """

    such as high-value transactions or unusual jurisdiction activity. This is the core logic engine
    for the compliance check, flagging items that require further investigation.

    Args:
        transactions_json (str): A JSON string containing a list of transaction objects.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string summarizing the analysis, including a list of flagged transactions
             with the reason for each flag.
    """
    try:
