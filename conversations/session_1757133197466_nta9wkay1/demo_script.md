## Customer Success Intelligence Hub for Xerox

---

## **[SECTION 1: OPENING & CONTEXT]** 
*Duration: 2 minutes*

### **Opening Hook**
"Good [morning/afternoon], and thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to show you how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can transform Xerox's customer success operations through intelligent automation.

**Key Message:** *"In the next 20 minutes, I'll demonstrate how we can reduce customer churn by 25% while increasing revenue protection by $2.5 million annually through AI-powered customer intelligence."*

### **Xerox Context Setting**
- "As we know, Xerox is navigating a critical transformation from traditional print services to digital solutions"
- "With declining traditional revenue streams and increasing competition from HP, Canon, and Ricoh, customer retention has never been more critical"
- "Your top 100 enterprise accounts represent 65% of recurring revenue - protecting and expanding these relationships is paramount"

### **Current Challenge Snapshot**
- "Today, your customer success teams spend 60% of their time on manual account analysis"
- "Churn signals are often identified too late for effective intervention"
- "Cross-sell opportunities are missed due to lack of proactive insights"

## **[SECTION 2: PROBLEM DEEP DIVE]**
*Duration: 2 minutes*

### **The Customer Success Dilemma**

**Pain Point 1: Reactive vs. Proactive**
- "Currently, teams react to problems after they escalate"
- "By the time a support ticket indicates dissatisfaction, the customer is already considering alternatives"
- Example: *"Last quarter, you lost a $500K account that showed warning signs 90 days earlier"*

**Pain Point 2: Data Silos**
- "Customer data lives across Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP, and Xerox Connect Analytics"
- "Success managers manually compile reports from 5+ systems"
- "Critical patterns are missed due to fragmented visibility"

**Pain Point 3: Scale Challenge**
- "Each CSM manages 15-20 enterprise accounts"
- "Manual health scoring takes 2 hours per account weekly"
- "High-value intervention opportunities are missed due to time constraints"

**Impact Statement:**
*"This reactive approach costs Xerox an estimated $8M annually in preventable churn and missed expansion opportunities"*
