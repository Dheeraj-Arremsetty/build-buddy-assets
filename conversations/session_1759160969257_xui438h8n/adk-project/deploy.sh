#!/bin/bash
# Generated deployment script

# Script block 1
pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-adk
    ```
3.  **ADK Dependencies**: Install necessary Python libraries for the tools. Create a `requirements.txt` file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    ```text
    # requirements.txt
    requests
    python-dotenv
    ```
4.  **watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: You must be logged into your watsonx Orchestrate environment via the CLI. If you have not configured and activated your environment, do so now:
    ```bash
    # Log in to your watsonx Orchestrate instance
    orchestrate login

    # (Optional) List environments to confirm setup
    orchestrate env list

    # (Optional) Activate the desired environment if not already active
    orchestrate env activate <your-environment-name>
    ```
