# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Financial Compliance Automation

## Overview
This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for building and demonstrating a sophisticated IBM watsonx Orchestrate solution for **FinSecure Analytics**, a financial services client. The primary business challenge is the manual, error-prone, and time-consuming process of quarterly financial compliance reporting. The current workflow requires analysts to manually gather transaction data from multiple systems, check it against a complex set of regulatory rules, identify anomalies, and compile a preliminary report. This process is a significant operational bottleneck and carries a high risk of non-compliance.

This demo will showcase a multi-agent "digital labor" pattern that automates the entire preliminary compliance review process. We will construct a hierarchical system of agents, where a `Compliance Supervisor Agent` orchestrates specialized collaborator agents for data aggregation, risk analysis, and report generation. The user, playing the role of a compliance officer, will trigger this complex workflow with a single, natural-language command. This solution will demonstrate watsonx Orchestrate's power to automate complex business processes, improve accuracy, reduce operational risk, and free up highly-skilled analysts to focus on strategic decision-making rather than repetitive data tasks.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning the implementation, ensure your development environment is correctly configured.

1.  **Python Environment**: A working installation of Python 3.8 or higher is required.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed. If not already installed, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-adk
    ```
3.  **ADK Dependencies**: Install necessary Python libraries for the tools. Create a `requirements.txt` file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    ```text
    # requirements.txt
    requests
    python-dotenv
    ```
4.  **watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: You must be logged into your watsonx Orchestrate environment via the CLI. If you have not configured and activated your environment, do so now:
    ```bash
    # Log in to your watsonx Orchestrate instance
    orchestrate login

    # (Optional) List environments to confirm setup
    orchestrate env list

    # (Optional) Activate the desired environment if not already active
    orchestrate env activate <your-environment-name>
    ```

## Step 1: Define Project Structure

To maintain clarity and organization, create the following directory structure for the project. This separation of concerns makes the project easier to manage and scale.

```
finsecure_demo/
├── agents/
│   ├── 01_data_aggregator_agent.yaml
│   ├── 02_risk_analysis_agent.yaml
│   ├── 03_report_generator_agent.yaml

```

## Step 2: Create Python Tools

We will now implement the Python functions that will serve as tools for our agents. Each tool performs a specific, atomic task, from data collection to analysis. The tools will generate realistic, synthetic data to simulate a real-world financial environment.

### A. Data Aggregation Tools

These tools are responsible for gathering the raw data needed for the compliance check.

#### Tool 1: `fetch_trade_data`

**Business Value**: This tool simulates connecting to a trading system or data warehouse to retrieve a list of transactions for a specific period. It forms the foundational dataset for the entire compliance process, ensuring that the analysis is based on a complete and relevant set of trades.

**Technical Implementation**: The function generates a list of 15 synthetic equity trades. Each trade is a dictionary containing essential details like a unique ID, ticker symbol, trade type, quantity, price, and timestamp. The data includes variations in tickers and timestamps to provide a rich dataset for the analysis tools. It returns a JSON-serializable list of these dictionaries.

```python
# tools/data_aggregation/fetch_trade_data.py
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="fetch_trade_data", description="Fetches recent equity trade data for a specified review period.", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def fetch_trade_data(review_period: str) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves a list of synthetic equity trades from a mock trading system for a given period.

    Args:
        review_period (str): A description of the review period, e.g., 'Q3 2024'.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string representing a list of trade data. Each trade includes an ID, timestamp, ticker, type, quantity, and price.
    """
    try:
        trades = []
        base_date = datetime.now()
        tickers = ["IBM", "AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "AMZN"]
        for i in range(15):
            trade_date = base_date - timedelta(days=random.randint(1, 90))
            trade = {
                "trade_id": f"TRD{1000 + i}",
                "timestamp": trade_date.isoformat(),
                "ticker": random.choice(tickers),
                "trade_type": random.choice(["BUY", "SELL"]),
                "quantity": random.randint(100, 50000),
                "price": round(random.uniform(150.0, 500.0), 2),
                "counterparty_id": f"CP{200 + i % 5}"
            }
            trades.append(trade)
        
        # Add a specific trade for volume limit testing
        trades.append({
            "trade_id": "TRD1015",
            "timestamp": (base_date - timedelta(days=10)).isoformat(),
            "ticker": "IBM",
            "trade_type": "BUY",
            "quantity": 150000, # Exceeds limit
            "price": 175.50,
            "counterparty_id": "CP201"
        })

        return json.dumps({"status": "success", "data": trades})
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "message": str(e)})

```

#### Tool 2: `fetch_counterparty_data`

**Business Value**: This tool simulates querying a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or Know Your Customer (KYC) system to get details about the
