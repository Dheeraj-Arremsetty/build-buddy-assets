### **Demo Script: The AI-Powered Store Operations Assistant with IBM watsonx Orchestrate**

**Presenter:** [Your Name/Demo Specialist Name]
**Audience:** Starbucks Operations & IT Leadership
**Total Duration:** 20 Minutes

---

### **Section 1: Opening & The Daily Grind (3 minutes)**

**[PRESENTER ON CAMERA/STAGE]**

**(0:00 - 1:00) Introduction & Setting the Scene**

*   "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with IBM watsonx."
*   "We're here to talk about something that happens thousands of times a day in every one of your stores: the quest for an answer."
*   "Imagine the morning rush. The line is out the door, mobile orders are piling up, and a new barista is trying to figure out the recipe for the latest promotional drink. At the same time, the Mastrena espresso machine is flashing an unfamiliar error code."
*   "Where do they turn? A binder on a shelf? A cluttered internal portal? Do they interrupt a busy shift supervisor who's already putting out three other fires?"

**(1:00 - 3:00) Defining the Business Challenge**

*   "This is the core challenge we're addressing. Your store partners are incredibly skilled, but they spend valuable time hunting for information instead of focusing on what they do best: crafting perfect beverages and creating that unique customer experience."
*   "This 'information scavenger hunt' leads to tangible business problems:"
    *   **Lost Productivity:** Every minute spent searching is a minute not serving customers. Across thousands of stores, this adds up to significant operational cost.
    *   **Inconsistent Execution:** When information is hard to find, partners rely on memory or 'tribal knowledge,' which can lead to variations in recipes, cleaning procedures, and customer service protocols.
    *   **Slower Onboarding:** New hires face a steep learning curve, having to navigate multiple systems and manuals just to learn the basics.
    *   **Equipment Downtime:** A simple-to-fix error code can take a machine offline for far too long if the troubleshooting guide isn't immediately accessible.

*   "The question is, how can we empower every employee, from a first-day barista to a seasoned store manager, with instant access to the single source of truth for any operational question they have?"

### **Section 2: The Solution: A Co-Pilot for Every Store (3 minutes)**

**[SHOW SLIDE: IBM watsonx Orchestrate Logo with "AI-Powered Store Operations Co-Pilot"]**

**(3:00 - 4:30) Introducing the Co-Pilot**

*   "Our solution is to build an **AI-Powered Store Operations Co-Pilot** using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. This isn't just another chatbot; it's a true digital assistant that works alongside your team."
*   "We've created a single, intuitive chat interface where any employee can ask a question in plain English and get an immediate, accurate answer."
*   "How? We started by creating a secure, curated knowledge base within Orchestrate. We ingested the exact documents you rely on today:"
    *   The **Mastrena II Operations Manual**
    *   The **Q3 Promotional Playbook**
    *   And the official **2024 Employee Handbook**
*   "This Co-Pilot now has expert knowledge grounded in *your* official documentation. It provides answers that are not just helpful, but also compliant and consistent."

**(4:30 - 6:00) Beyond Q&A: From Information to Action**

*   "But Orchestrate does more than just answer questions. It can take action. Using the Orchestrate Agent Development Kit, or ADK, we've given the Co-Pilot skills."
*   "We've built a multi-agent system:"
    *   A main **Supervisor Agent** that understands the user's intent.
    *   Specialized **Collaborator Agents** for HR and Maintenance.
    *   And a custom **Tool** that can connect to your service management systems.
*   "This means when a problem goes beyond a simple question, the Co-Pilot can intelligently delegate the task or even kick off a business process, like logging a maintenance ticket."
*   "Enough talk. Let's see it in action. I'm going to play the role of a store employee interacting with our new Co-Pilot."

### **Section 3: Live Demo - A Day in the Life (8 minutes)**

**[SWITCH TO DEMO SCREEN - `orchestrate chat start` INTERFACE]**

**(6:00 - 8:00) Scenario 1: Foundational Knowledge - Equipment Operations**

*   "Okay, I'm a barista on my closing shift. It's time for daily maintenance, but I'm not 100% sure about the cleaning steps for our most important piece of equipment."
*   "Instead of searching for the manual, I'll just ask the Co-Pilot."

    *   **USER PROMPT:** `What are the steps to clean the Mastrena II espresso machine?`

*   **[PRESENTER NARRATES AS THE AGENT RESPONDS]**
*   "Right now, the `Store_Operations_CoPilot` is performing a conversational search across its knowledge base. It's identified the Mastrena II Manual as the relevant source and is extracting the precise steps."

    *   **EXPECTED OUTPUT:** `"Here are the daily cleaning procedures for the Mastrena II: 1. Turn off the machine... 2. Remove the grounds drawer... 3. Wipe down the exterior... 4. Run the automated cleaning cycle... 5. Rinse the portafilter and steam wand."`

*   "Perfect. A clear, step-by-step answer in seconds. No searching, no ambiguity. This ensures consistency and proper equipment care across every single store."

**(8:00 - 10:30) Scenario 2: Intelligent Delegation - Handling a Policy Question**

*   "Now for a more nuanced situation. A customer is upset about a mobile order. I need to know the official company policy for handling this."
*   "This isn't about equipment; it's an HR policy. Let's see how the Co-Pilot handles a different type of request."

    *   **USER PROMPT:** `What is the policy for handling a customer complaint about a mobile order?`

*   **[PRESENTER NARRATES]**
*   "This is where the intelligence of the multi-agent system shines. The main Supervisor agent recognizes the keywords 'policy' and 'customer complaint.' Its instructions tell it that the `HR_Policy_Agent` is the expert for this."
*   "Behind the scenes, it's delegating the query to that specialized agent, which has a focused instruction to only answer using the Employee Handbook. This ensures the right expert answers the question and prevents the agent from giving an opinion or incorrect information."

    *   **EXPECTED OUTPUT:** `"According to the employee handbook, you should follow the 4-step 'LISTEN' method: 1. Listen: Allow the customer to explain the issue without interruption. 2. Inquire: Ask clarifying questions... 3. Sympathize... 4. Take Action: Offer a solution, such as remaking the order or providing a recovery coupon."`

*   "Again, an instant, corporate-approved answer. This empowers every barista to handle difficult situations with confidence and consistency, directly improving the customer experience."

**(10:30 - 14:00) Scenario 3: From Information to ACTION - Task Automation**

*   "Okay, for our final and most powerful scenario, let's say our Mastrena II is actually broken. I've tried the basic troubleshooting, but it's still showing an error."

    *   **USER PROMPT:** `The Mastrena II is showing error code E-21 and won't turn on. I've tried the troubleshooting steps.`

*   **[PRESENTER NARRATES]**
*   "The Co-Pilot sees 'error code E-21' and 'troubleshooting steps failed'. It knows this is no longer a simple question. It's a request for action."
*   "It now delegates the entire conversation to the `Maintenance_Request_Agent`. This agent's only job is to log service tickets."
*   "The Maintenance Agent will now use the custom Python tool we built, `log_maintenance_ticket`, to interact with an external system."

    *   **EXPECTED AGENT FOLLOW-UP:** `"I can log a maintenance ticket for the Mastrena II with error code E-21. Is that correct?"`

*   "The agent confirms the details with me before taking action. I'll simply say 'yes'."

    *   **USER PROMPT:** `Yes`

*   **[PRESENTER NARRATES]**
*   "The tool is now executing. In a real-world scenario, this would be making a secure API call to your ServiceNow, Jira, or other maintenance platform. For this demo, it's simulating that call."

    *   **EXPECTED FINAL OUTPUT:** `"Successfully logged maintenance ticket #INC78989. A technician will be dispatched."`

*   **[PAUSE FOR EFFECT]**
*   "Think about the impact of that. We went from a broken machine to a logged service ticket with a confirmation number in under a minute, all through a simple conversation. This minimizes equipment downtime, protects revenue, and gets the store back to full capacity faster than any manual process could."

### **Section 4: Business Value & Technical Highlights (3 minutes)**

**[SWITCH BACK TO SLIDES - SLIDE 1: Business Value Recap]**

**(14:00 - 15:30) Summarizing the Business Value**

*   "What we just saw was more than a tech demo; it was a blueprint for operational excellence. Let’s recap the value:"
    *   **Increased Efficiency:** We dramatically reduced the time spent searching for information. If we save each employee just 5 minutes per shift, the productivity gains at scale are immense.
    *   **Improved Consistency & Compliance:** By grounding the AI in your official documents, every answer aligns with corporate standards, from drink recipes to HR policies.
    *   **Accelerated Onboarding:** A new hire can ask the Co-Pilot anything, effectively giving them a 24/7 expert trainer, reducing the burden on managers and speeding up time-to-competency.
    *   **Proactive Operations:** We turned a reactive problem—a broken machine—into a proactive, automated workflow, minimizing downtime and protecting the customer experience.

**[NEXT SLIDE - SLIDE 2: How it was built - Simple Diagram of Supervisor -> Collaborators -> Tool/KB]**

**(15:30 - 17:00) A Glimpse "Under the Hood"**

*   "You might think building something this powerful is complex, but watsonx Orchestrate is designed for rapid development. We built this entire solution using the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**."
*   **Agents are defined in simple YAML files**, where we write the plain-English instructions that guide their behavior and reasoning.
*   **The Knowledge Base was created by simply pointing to your existing PDF and Word documents.** Orchestrate handles the complex process of indexing and making them searchable.
*   **The Action-taking Tool was a standard Python function.** We added a simple decorator to make it available to Orchestrate, ready to be called to make an API request to any of your backend systems.
*   "This builder-focused approach means your teams can create, update, and scale these AI Co-Pilots quickly, adapting them as your business processes evolve."

### **Section 5: Q&A and Next Steps (3 minutes)**

**(17:00 - 19:00) Prepared Q&A**

*   "I'd like to open it up for questions, but let me anticipate a few common ones."
*   **Q1: How secure is this? Can we control access to sensitive information like HR policies?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely. Security is paramount. We can create multiple, scoped knowledge bases. For example, HR documents could be in a separate knowledge base only accessible to an agent that store managers can use, ensuring role-based access control. Tool permissions can also be restricted.
*   **Q2: How do we connect this to our real systems, like our actual maintenance ticketing platform?**
    *   **A:** That Python tool we showed is the bridge. Instead of printing a mock ticket number, we would simply add the code to make a secure, authenticated API call to your system's endpoint. Orchestrate handles the connection and credential management securely.
*   **Q3: How difficult is it to update the knowledge base when a new promotional playbook or policy is released?**
    *   **A:** It's incredibly simple. You just add the new document to the configuration file and run a single command to re-import the knowledge base. The Co-Pilot is instantly updated with the latest information.

*   "What other questions do you have?" **[PAUSE FOR LIVE Q&A]**

**(19:00 - 20:00) Call to Action**

*   "What we've shown today is just the beginning. Imagine expanding this Co-Pilot with agents for inventory management, scheduling queries, or sales reporting."
*   "The clear next step is a **Discovery Workshop**. We'd like to sit down with your operations team to identify the top 3-5 highest-value use cases in your stores."
*   "From there, we can launch a Proof of Concept, using your actual documentation, to build a working prototype of your Store Operations Co-Pilot in a matter of weeks, not months."
*   "Thank you for your time and attention. We're excited about the possibility of partnering with you to bring the power of AI to every one of your stores."
