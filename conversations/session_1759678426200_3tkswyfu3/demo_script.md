### **Section 2: The Challenge: The Manual "Swivel Chair" Process (3 Minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"Before we dive into the solution, let's talk about the process we see today. We call it the 'swivel chair' workflow, and it probably looks very familiar.

When you're tasked with developing a new course—let's say on 'Generative AI Agents'—the research process begins.

*   **Step 1: Competitor Analysis.** A developer opens a dozen browser tabs, searching for what leading universities, corporate training platforms, and competitors are teaching. They manually copy and paste module titles, learning objectives, and key topics into a spreadsheet or document.
*   **Step 2: Market Demand Analysis.** They then pivot to job posting sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, or Dice. They run searches for 'GenAI Agent Developer' and spend hours sifting through job descriptions, trying to spot patterns and identify the most frequently requested skills—Python, LangChain, vector databases, API integration, etc.
*   **Step 3: Synthesis & Reporting.** Finally, all this disconnected, unstructured data has to be manually compiled, summarized, and formatted into a coherent research brief.

**This manual process creates several critical business challenges:**

*   **It's Incredibly Time-Consuming:** We estimate this initial research phase can take anywhere from **20 to 40 hours of expert time** per course.
*   **It's Prone to Inconsistency:** Different team members may search differently, leading to incomplete or biased data.
*   **It Causes Delays:** The longer research takes, the longer it takes to get a new, in-demand course to market, potentially missing a critical window of opportunity.
*   **It Burns Out Your Experts:** Your talented curriculum developers are spending their time on low-value data collection instead of high-value instructional design and content creation.

This is a problem that is perfectly suited for AI-powered automation."

### **Section 3: The Solution: Your AI-Powered Curriculum Assistant (3 Minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"This is where IBM watsonx Orchestrate comes in. We haven't just built a tool; we've enabled you to build a **digital workforce**.

For this use case, we've configured an AI agent we call the **'Curriculum Research Assistant.'**

Think of this agent as a new member of your team. It's available 24/7 through a simple chat interface. You give it a task in plain English, and it goes to work.

Behind the scenes, this agent is powered by a **supervisor AI** that orchestrates a set of custom-built tools to execute the task. For today's demo, it will use three key tools:

1.  **Competitor Course Search Tool:** A tool we built that connects to web search APIs to specifically find and extract course outlines from top educational and competitor websites.
2.  **Job Skill Analyzer Tool:** This tool scrapes and analyzes data from major job boards to identify, count, and rank the most in-demand skills and technologies for a given topic.
3.  **Report Synthesizer Tool:** After the other tools gather the raw data, this tool uses a generative AI model to summarize, structure, and synthesize the findings into a clean, actionable report.

The value proposition is simple but powerful: we're transforming a **multi-day, manual process into an automated, on-demand task that takes minutes.** This allows your team to move from data gathering to data-driven decision-making instantly."

### **Section 4: Live Demonstration (7 Minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points & Demo Flow)**

"Alright, enough talk. Let's see the Curriculum Research Assistant in action.

**[ACTION: Switch screen to the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface]**

What you're looking at is the simple, intuitive interface for watsonx Orchestrate. As a curriculum developer, this is where my day would start. I've just been assigned to scope out our new 'GenAI Agents' course. Instead of opening my browser, I'm going to talk to my assistant.

**Step 1: The Prompt**

I'll type in a natural language request. Notice I'm not using any special commands or code.

**[ACTION: Type the following prompt into the chat window]**

> `"I need to design a new course on 'GenAI Agents'. Please research the market for me. Find out what the top 3 competitor courses cover, identify the top 10 most in-demand skills from recent job postings, and summarize it all in a structured report."`

**[ACTION: Press Enter]**

**Step 2: The Orchestration (Explain while it runs)**

"Now, watsonx Orchestrate is kicking into gear. The supervisor agent has analyzed my request and created a plan.

*   **First,** it's invoking the `CompetitorCourseSearch` tool. Right now, it's scanning the web for courses on this topic from leading platforms.
*   **Simultaneously,** it's calling the `JobSkillAnalyzer` tool. This tool is querying job sites for roles related to 'GenAI Agents' and is parsing hundreds of listings to extract key skills.
*   **Finally,** once the data is collected, it will be passed to the `ReportSynthesizer` tool, which will create the final output you're about to see.

This entire multi-step, complex workflow is happening automatically, without any human intervention."

**[PAUSE for 15-20 seconds as the agent "thinks"]**

**Step 3: The Output**

**[ACTION: The agent returns the formatted report in the chat window. Point to each section as you talk.]**

"And here we have it. In less than a minute, I have a comprehensive research brief. Let's break it down.

*   **`Section 1: Competitor Course Analysis`**
    *   "As you can see, it has identified three top courses and summarized their core modules. We see common themes like 'Large Language Models (LLMs) Foundations,' 'Prompt Engineering,' 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),' and 'Agentic Tool Use.' This is invaluable for structuring our own outline."

*   **`Section 2: Top 10 In-Demand Market Skills`**
    *   "This is the critical data from the job market. The agent has ranked the skills by frequency. We see **Python** and **LangChain/LlamaIndex** at the top, followed by **API Integration**, **Vector Databases** like Pinecone, and knowledge of **OpenAI/Anthropic models**. This tells us exactly what technical skills our course *must* cover to be relevant."

*   **`Section 3: Executive Summary & Recommendations`**
    *   "Finally, the agent provides a quick summary, even suggesting a potential gap in the market—for example, 'Few courses offer advanced modules on multi-agent collaboration.' This is an actionable insight that can help us differentiate our course."

**Step 4: Conversational Follow-up**

"But it doesn't stop there. This is a conversational assistant. I can ask a follow-up question."

**[ACTION: Type a follow-up prompt]**

> `"Based on that report, what are the top 3 skills to focus on for an introductory-level course?"`

**[ACTION: Agent quickly provides a refined answer, e.g., "For an introductory course, I would recommend focusing on: 1. Python Fundamentals, 2. Core Prompt Engineering, and 3. Basic API Integration."]**

"And just like that, I have a clear starting point for my course design, backed by real-time market data. The 20-hour research task is now complete."

### **Section 6: Q&A Preparation and Next Steps (3 Minutes)**

**(Presenter Talking Points)**

"That concludes the formal demonstration. I'd now like to open it up for any questions you may have."

**(Anticipated Q&A and Prepared Answers)**

*   **Q: How difficult is it to build these custom tools?**
    *   **A:** "It's very straightforward for a developer. The tools are built using standard Python and our Agent Development Kit (ADK). If you have developers who can work with APIs and Python, you can build custom tools. We also provide extensive documentation and support to get you started."

*   **Q: Can this connect to our internal systems, like our Learning Management System (LMS) or project management tools?**
    *   **A:** "Absolutely. That's a core strength of Orchestrate. We can build tools that connect to any system with an API. Imagine asking the agent, 'Create a new course shell in our LMS for 'GenAI Agents' and create a project ticket in Jira.' That's entirely possible."

*   **Q: What about the security of the data it's accessing?**
    *   **A:** "Security is paramount. The agent operates within your secure IBM Cloud environment. Access to tools and data sources is managed through permissions and standard enterprise security protocols. You have full control over what the agent can see and do."

*   **Q: Which Large Language Model (LLM) is powering this?**
    *   **A:** "watsonx Orchestrate is model-agnostic, but it is deeply integrated with our own **watsonx.ai** platform, giving you access to IBM's Granite series models and a range of other open-source and third-party models. This allows you to choose the best model for the task while maintaining data privacy and governance."

**(Call to Action / Next Steps)**

"Thank you again for your time. The clear next step is to make this real for your team.

We'd like to propose a **90-minute discovery workshop** with your key curriculum developers. In that session, we'll map out one of your most critical research workflows in detail. From there, we can scope a proof-of-concept to build a custom research assistant tailored directly to your unique needs.

Who would be the best person to coordinate scheduling that workshop?

Thank you."
