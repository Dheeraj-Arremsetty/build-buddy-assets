# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: Barista Buddy Demo

## 1. Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building the "Barista Buddy" demo using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. This demo is specifically tailored for the client to showcase how Orchestrate can address their key business challenges: accelerating barista onboarding, ensuring recipe consistency across all locations, and empowering employees with instant access to information.

The solution architecture implements a sophisticated multi-agent system featuring a **Supervisor Agent** (`Barista Buddy`) that intelligently routes tasks to specialized **Collaborator Agents**. The `Recipe Master` agent leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions from a knowledge base of official company documents, directly solving the need for consistent training. The `Operations Assistant` agent uses custom Python tools to interact with mock store systems, demonstrating how Orchestrate can automate operational tasks like inventory checks and maintenance logging. This plan will guide you through creating the mock data, building the knowledge base, developing the custom tools, configuring all three agents, and deploying the full solution for a compelling and relevant demonstration.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is properly configured. This is essential for the successful creation and deployment of the agents and tools outlined in this plan.

*   **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit must be installed. If you haven't installed it, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install "ibm-watsonx-orchestrate"
    ```
*   **Python Environment**: A working Python environment (version 3.10 or higher) is required.
*   **watsonx Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. This includes logging in via the CLI and initializing the environment.
    ```bash
    # Log in to your IBM Cloud account
    orchestrate login

    # Initialize your environment (follow the prompts)
    orchestrate env init
    ```
*   **watsonx.ai Account**: An account with access to watsonx.ai is necessary to power the Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedding models used by the agents. Ensure your environment is configured with the appropriate API keys.

## 3. Project Structure Setup

To keep the project organized, we will create a structured directory. This ensures that all configuration files, tools, and documents are easy to locate and manage.

1.  Create a main project folder named `barista-buddy-demo`.
2.  Inside this folder, create the following subdirectories:
    *   `agents`: To store the YAML configuration files for our three agents.
    *   `tools`: To store the Python file containing our custom tools.
    *   `knowledge_base_docs`: To store the mock PDF and TXT files for our knowledge base.

Your project structure should look like this:

```
barista-buddy-demo/
├── agents/
├── tools/
└── knowledge_base_docs/
```

## 4. Step 1: Create Mock Data and Knowledge Base

The `Recipe Master` agent relies on a knowledge base to answer questions. We will create mock documents and a YAML configuration to define this knowledge base.

### 4.1. Create Mock Documents

1.  **Recipe & Procedure Manual**: Create a file named `barista_manual.txt` inside the
