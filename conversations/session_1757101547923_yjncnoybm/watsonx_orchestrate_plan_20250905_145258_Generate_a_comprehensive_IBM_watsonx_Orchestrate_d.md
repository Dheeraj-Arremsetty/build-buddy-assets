# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan

## Overview
This execution plan is tailored for S&P Global to demonstrate an AI-driven credit rating analysis system using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The goal is to automate and enhance the credit rating process, improving accuracy, consistency, and real-time responsiveness to market changes. The architecture includes multiple agents, each designed to handle specific parts of the credit rating workflow using synthetic data that mimics real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites
1. **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: Install the latest version of the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit.
   ```bash
   pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
   ```

2. **Python Development Environment**: Set up a Python environment with an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.

3. **Access to IBM watsonx Orchestrate Platform**: Ensure access with necessary permissions to create and manage agents and tools.

4. **Synthetic Data Preparation**: Prepare synthetic data that includes mock financial statements, ESG metrics, and market data.

## Step 1: Create YAML Configuration

### Financial Data Agent
**Purpose**: Extracts and normalizes synthetic financial data from documents like mock 10-Ks and 10-Qs.
**Business Value**: Automates data extraction, reducing manual labor and increasing speed and accuracy.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: financial_data_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
  Extracts and normalizes synthetic financial data from mock 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and earnings calls.
instructions: >
  Use the financial_data_extractor tool to extract data and data_normalizer to normalize it.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - financial_data_extractor
  - data_normalizer
```

### ESG Risk Agent
**Purpose**: Analyzes synthetic ESG metrics and climate risk factors.
**Business Value**: Provides crucial insights into ESG risks for comprehensive credit assessments.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: esg_risk_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: react
description: >
  Analyzes synthetic ESG metrics and climate risk factors.
instructions: >
  Use the esg_analyzer tool for ESG metrics and risk_factor_evaluator for climate risks.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - esg_analyzer
  - risk_factor_evaluator
```

## Step 2: Create Tools

### Financial Data Extractor
**Purpose**: Extracts financial information from documents.
**Business Value**: Automates data extraction, reducing manual data entry.

```python
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="financial_data_extractor", description="Extracts financial data from documents", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def extract_financial_data(document_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Extracts financial data from the specified document.

    Args:
        document_id (str): The ID of the document to extract data from.

    Returns:
        dict: Extracted financial data including revenue, expenses, and net income.
    """
    try:
        # Simulate data extraction logic
        return {
            "revenue": 1000000,
            "expenses": 500000,
            "net_income": 500000
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}
```

### Data Normalizer
**Purpose**: Normalizes extracted financial data for consistency.
**Business Value**: Ensures uniformity and reliability in data handling.

```python
@tool(name="data_normalizer", description="Normalizes extracted financial data", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def normalize_financial_data(raw_data: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Normalizes raw financial data for consistency.

    Args:
        raw_data (dict): Raw financial data to normalize.

    Returns:
        dict: Normalized financial data.
    """
    try:
        normalized_data = {key: float(value) for key, value in raw_data.items()}
        return normalized_data
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}
```

### ESG Analyzer
**Purpose**: Analyzes ESG metrics.
**Business Value**: Provides insights into environmental, social, and governance factors affecting credit ratings.

```python
@tool(name="esg_analyzer", description="Analyzes ESG metrics", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def analyze_esg_metrics(company_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Analyzes ESG metrics for the given company.

    Args:
        company_id (str): The ID of the company to analyze.

    Returns:
        dict: ESG analysis results including scores and risk factors.
    """
    try:
        # Simulate ESG analysis
        return {
            "environmental_score": 85,
            "social_score": 78,
            "governance_score": 80,
            "risk_factors": ["Climate Risk", "Social Responsibility"]
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}
```

### Risk Factor Evaluator
**Purpose**: Evaluates climate risk factors.
**Business Value**: Identifies potential risks affecting company sustainability scores.

```python
@tool(name="risk_factor_evaluator", description="Evaluates climate risk factors", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def evaluate_risk_factors(company_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Evaluates climate risk factors for the given company.

    Args:
        company_id (str): The ID of the company to evaluate.

    Returns:
        dict: Risk evaluation results including significant climate risks.
    """
    try:
        # Simulate risk evaluation
        return {
            "climate_risk": "High",
            "impact_areas": ["Energy Consumption", "Carbon Emissions"]
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}
```

## Step 3: Import Tools and Agents

**Import Tools**: Use the following CLI commands to import tools.

```bash
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/extract_financial_data.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/normalize_financial_data.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/analyze_esg_metrics.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/evaluate_risk_factors.py
```

**Import Agents**: Use the following commands to import agents.

```bash
orchestrate agents import -f financial_data_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f esg_risk_agent.yaml
```

## Verification
1. **Test Tool Execution**: Execute individual tools using test data to ensure they perform as expected.
2. **Agent Interaction**: Simulate interactions with agents using the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface to ensure they respond correctly and integrate effectively.
3. **Data Validation**: Validate extracted and processed data against synthetic sources to ensure accuracy.

## Troubleshooting
- **Tool Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the Python files are error-free before importing.
- **Agent Configuration Issues**: Double-check YAML configurations for syntax errors.
- **Data Discrepancies**: Validate synthetic data generation if inconsistencies arise.

## Best Practices
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for each tool and agent, detailing their purpose, inputs, outputs, and expected behavior.
- **Version Control**: Use systems like Git to manage changes in configurations and code.
- **Security Considerations**: Implement proper security measures, especially when handling synthetic data.
- **Scalability**: Design tools and agents to be easily scalable, allowing future enhancements and additional functionalities.

This comprehensive execution plan ensures a robust implementation of the demo, addressing all client-specific requirements and showcasing IBM watsonx Orchestrate's capabilities in automating and enhancing credit rating processes.
