### **S&P Global: A Research Analysis**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

### **Executive Summary**

S&P Global is a dominant force in the financial information and analytics industry, built on a foundation of credit ratings, market data, and benchmark indices. The company has successfully transitioned from a traditional data provider to a technology-driven enterprise, solidified by its transformative $44 billion merger with IHS Markit in 2022. This acquisition significantly expanded its datasets and market reach into high-growth sectors like energy transition and automotive.

Financially, S&P Global is robust, with a market capitalization exceeding $115 billion and a diversified, largely subscription-based revenue model that ensures stability. The company's core strategy revolves around integrating its vast and proprietary datasets with advanced artificial intelligence, spearheaded by its in-house AI engine, Kensho Technologies. While S&P Global had an early-mover advantage in AI, it now faces intense competition from peers like Moody's, Bloomberg, and LSEG (Refinitiv), all of whom are aggressively launching their own domain-specific generative AI solutions. The company's future success will depend on its ability to leverage its unique data and AI capabilities to deliver differentiated, high-value insights in an increasingly competitive market.

### **1. Industry and Market Positioning**

#### **Primary Industry and Sub-Industries**

S&P Global operates within the **Financial Information and Analytics Services** industry. This sector is characterized by the provision of data, research, analytics, and benchmark services that are essential for the functioning of global capital and commodity markets.

The company's operations are diversified across several key sub-industries:
*   **Credit Rating Services:** A foundational part of its business, providing credit ratings, research, and outlooks for debt instruments issued by corporations, governments, and other entities.
*   **Market and Data Intelligence:** Offering data, analytics, and software platforms for finance professionals, including desktop solutions like Capital IQ Pro.
*   **Indices:** Licensing iconic financial benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to asset managers for ETFs, index funds, and derivatives.
*   **Commodity and Energy Insights:** Providing price benchmarks (e.g., Platts), data, and analytics for the global energy, petrochemicals, and metals markets.
*   **Mobility and Automotive Analytics:** Supplying data and insights on automotive sales, supply chains, and technology trends, a capability significantly enhanced by the IHS Markit merger.

#### **Market Position and Differentiation**

S&P Global holds a commanding market position, often as a leader or in a duopolistic/oligopolistic structure within its key segments.

*   **Ratings:** It is one of the "Big Three" credit rating agencies, alongside Moody's and Fitch Ratings. This segment benefits from high regulatory barriers to entry and strong brand recognition, creating a significant competitive moat.
*   **Indices:** It is the world's leading index provider. The S&P 500 is arguably the most important equity benchmark globally, making its index business a highly profitable and sticky revenue source.
*   **Market Intelligence:** S&P Global is a top-tier competitor against rivals like Bloomberg, Refinitiv (LSEG), and FactSet.
*   **Commodity Insights:** Through its Platts division, it is a primary source for benchmark pricing in many global commodity markets, especially oil.

**Differentiation** is achieved through several key factors:
1.  **Scale and Breadth of Proprietary Data:** The 2022 merger with IHS Markit created an unparalleled data powerhouse, combining deep financial data with extensive datasets in transportation, energy, and other industries.
2.  **Embedded Workflow Integration:** Its products, such as Capital IQ, are deeply integrated into the daily workflows of financial professionals, creating high switching costs.
3.  **Benchmark Status:** The indispensable nature of its ratings and indices makes its services non-discretionary for many market participants.
4.  **Early Investment in AI:** The 2018 acquisition of AI firm **Kensho Technologies** gave S&P Global a significant head start in applying machine learning and AI to its proprietary data assets.

### **2. Financial Status**

S&P Global demonstrates strong financial health, characterized by consistent revenue growth, high-profit margins, and a stable, subscription-heavy business model.

*   **Valuation:** As of October 2023, S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) has a market capitalization of approximately **$116 billion**.
*   **Revenue:** For the full year 2022, the company reported revenue of **$11.18 billion**. The merger with IHS Markit was a primary driver of a significant pro-forma revenue increase. In its Q2 2023 earnings report, the company reported quarterly revenue of **$3.1 billion**, demonstrating continued growth.
*   **Funding and Financial Health:** S&P Global is a publicly traded, financially self-sufficient entity. Its business model generates strong and predictable cash flows, particularly from its subscription-based divisions (Market Intelligence, Indices). The Ratings division, while more transactional and cyclical, remains highly profitable. The company maintains an investment-grade credit rating, reflecting its strong financial position and market leadership.
*   **Recent Challenges:** The primary financial challenge has been the macroeconomic environment. Rising interest rates have led to a slowdown in debt issuance globally, which directly impacts the revenue of the Ratings division. However, the company's diversified model, with strong performance in its other subscription-based segments, has helped mitigate this cyclical downturn.

### **3. Revenue Generation**

S&P Global's income is generated through a diversified mix of subscription-based and transaction-based models across its primary business divisions.

1.  **Ratings (~26% of Q2 2023 Revenue):** This division operates on a largely **transaction-based model**. Issuers (corporations, governments) pay S&P Global to have their debt instruments rated. Revenue is therefore correlated with the volume of debt issuance in capital markets. It also includes revenue from non-transactional sources like surveillance fees and research subscriptions.
2.  **Market Intelligence (~35% of Q2 2023 Revenue):** This is primarily a **subscription-based model**. Clients subscribe to data and analytics platforms like Capital IQ Pro and S&P Global Marketplace. This provides highly recurring and predictable revenue.
3.  **Commodity Insights (~12% of Q2 2023 Revenue):** Revenue comes from **subscriptions** to its real-time news, market data, and benchmark pricing services (Platts).
4.  **Mobility (~12% of Q2 2023 Revenue):** This division, largely from the IHS Markit acquisition, generates revenue from **subscriptions and one-time sales** of data, forecasting, and analytics related to the automotive industry.
5.  **Indices (~12% of Q2 2023 Revenue):** This division operates on an **asset-based and subscription-based model**. Its primary income stream comes from licensing fees paid by issuers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other indexed financial products. These fees are typically based on the assets under management (AUM) in those products.

### **4. Offerings: Service-Based vs. Digital Products**

S&P Global's offerings can be categorized into analytical services and digital, platform-based products.

#### **Service-Based Offerings**
These offerings are centered on human expertise, analysis, and the delivery of a judgment or benchmark.
*   **Credit Ratings:** The core service offering. An analyst team conducts in-depth due diligence and assigns a credit rating, which is an expert opinion on creditworthiness.
*   **Benchmarking Services:** The creation and maintenance of commodity price benchmarks (e.g., Platts Dated Brent) is a service that requires constant market surveillance and expert judgment.
*   **Consulting and Advisory:** Providing bespoke research and analysis to clients on specific market or industry topics.

#### **Digital Products**
These are technology-driven platforms that provide users with direct access to data and analytical tools.
*   **Capital IQ Pro:** The company's flagship desktop platform, providing an integrated solution for financial data, analytics, and research. It is a direct competitor to the Bloomberg Terminal and Refinitiv Eikon.
*   **S&P Global Marketplace:** A data-as-a-service platform where clients can explore, purchase, and access S&P's vast array of datasets via APIs and other delivery methods.
*   **Specialized Platforms:** A suite of digital products tailored to specific industries, such as automotive (Mobility division) and energy (Commodity Insights division), providing workflow tools, data visualization, and analytics.

### **5. AI Strategy**

S&P Global's AI strategy is central to its goal of transforming data into actionable intelligence. The strategy is executed primarily through its in-house AI center of excellence, **Kensho Technologies**.

The approach is twofold:
1.  **Internal Efficiency:** Using AI to automate data collection, extraction, and linking, thereby improving the speed and accuracy of its analysts.
2.  **Customer-Facing Innovation:** Embedding AI-powered features into its digital products to help clients uncover novel insights, identify risks, and automate their own workflows.

**Key Components of the AI Strategy:**
*   **Proprietary Data as a Moat:** S&P Global's core advantage is training AI and machine learning models on its vast, structured, and unstructured proprietary datasets, which are not available to the general public or competitors. This allows for the creation of highly specialized, domain-specific AI.
*   **Kensho as the Engine:** Kensho provides capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and data visualization. Its tools are used to transcribe and analyze earnings calls, link disparate datasets, and power search functions within Capital IQ Pro.
*   **Generative AI:** The company is actively developing and deploying generative AI capabilities. Its focus is on building a proprietary LLM-powered "chat" interface that allows users to ask complex questions in natural language and receive synthesized answers, complete with citations back to the source S&P Global data. This is designed to ensure accuracy and traceability, mitigating the risk of "hallucinations" common in general-purpose models.
*   **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** While not explicitly marketed under this term, S&P Global's strategic direction aligns with the principles of multi-agent systems. This advanced concept involves deploying multiple specialized AI "agents" that collaborate to solve complex problems. For example, one agent could monitor real-time news for geopolitical risk, another could analyze its impact on commodity prices using Platts data, a third could model the effect on a company's supply chain using Mobility data, and an orchestrator agent would synthesize these inputs to provide a comprehensive risk assessment. This represents the next frontier for leveraging their diverse, interconnected datasets.

### **6. Competitor AI Innovation**

The race to deploy generative AI is a key competitive battleground in the financial information industry. S&P Global's main competitors are making significant strides.

*   **Bloomberg:** Bloomberg's most significant move is the development of **BloombergGPT**, a 50-billion parameter large language model trained from scratch on decades of curated financial data. This model is specifically designed to handle financial NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, news classification, and question answering. It represents a direct and powerful competitive threat, aiming to make Bloomberg's data more accessible and useful through a natural language interface.
*   **Moody's:** Moody's has launched the **Moody's Research Assistant**, a generative AI tool built on its own proprietary content. It allows clients to use natural language queries to search, summarize, and analyze Moody's extensive library of credit research and data, enhancing the accessibility and utility of its core product.
*   **LSEG (Refinitiv):** The London Stock Exchange Group has a strategic partnership with **Microsoft**. It is integrating Microsoft Azure OpenAI and other generative AI capabilities across its product suite, including its flagship Workspace platform. This collaboration aims to allow users to conversationally query LSEG's data, automate model creation, and generate insights, leveraging Microsoft's AI infrastructure with LSEG's vast data assets.
*   **Fitch Ratings:** Like its peers, Fitch is also investing in AI and machine learning, primarily to enhance the efficiency and analytical depth of its internal credit rating processes. Its public-facing AI initiatives are currently less prominent than those of S&P Global or Moody's.

**Analysis:** The competitive landscape is defined by a race to build domain-specific AI models. The ultimate winners will be the firms that can best combine three elements: **(1)** the highest quality proprietary data for training, **(2)** a robust and intuitive user interface, and **(3)** a clear ability to deliver accurate, traceable, and actionable insights that clients can trust for critical decision-making. S&P Global's early acquisition of Kensho provided a valuable head start, but the rapid advancements by Bloomberg and strategic partnerships like LSEG-Microsoft indicate that sustained innovation will be critical to maintaining a competitive edge.
