## Execution Plan

# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan for Global Logistics Inc.

## Overview
This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for creating a powerful IBM watsonx Orchestrate demo tailored to the business needs of **Global Logistics Inc.** The primary objective is to showcase how watsonx Orchestrate can automate the complex, multi-system process of resolving shipment exceptions. Currently, this process involves manual coordination between the Transportation Management System (TMS), customs brokerage systems, and customer communication channels, leading to delays, increased operational costs, and reduced customer satisfaction.

This demo will construct a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that automates the entire "shipment exception resolution" workflow. A supervisor agent will orchestrate a team of specialized collaborator agents, each responsible for a specific domain: shipment data management, customs compliance, customer communications, and incident reporting. This solution will demonstrate how watsonx Orchestrate can seamlessly integrate disparate systems, automate decision-making, and provide a single, conversational interface for logistics coordinators to manage and resolve complex supply chain issues efficiently.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning the implementation, ensure your development environment is set up with the following components. This setup is crucial for building, importing, and testing the agents and tools outlined in this plan.

1.  **Python 3.8 or higher**: The watsonx Orchestrate ADK is a Python library. Ensure a compatible version of Python is installed and accessible from your terminal.
2.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit is the core dependency. Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```
3.  **Text Editor or IDE**: A code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for writing and managing the Python tool files and YAML agent configurations.
4.  **Terminal/Command Line**: You will need a terminal to execute the `orchestrate` CLI commands for importing tools and agents, and for interacting with the chat interface.
5.  **Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment configured. Initialize your environment by running:
    ```bash
    orchestrate environment init
    ```
    Follow the prompts to log in and select your environment.

## Step 1: Define the Project Structure
A well-organized project structure is essential for managing the different components of your watsonx Orchestrate solution. Create the following directory structure in your project's root folder.

```
global_logistics_demo/
├── agents/
│   ├── 01_shipment_data_agent.yaml
│   ├── 02_customs_compliance_agent.yaml
│   ├── 03_customer_comms_agent.yaml
│   ├── 04_reporting_agent.yaml
│   └── 05_supervisor_logistics_agent.yaml
├── tools/
│   ├── shipment_tools.py
│   ├── customs_tools.py
│   ├── communication_tools.py
│   └── reporting_tools.py
└── requirements.txt
```

*   **`agents/`**: This directory will contain all the YAML configuration files for the agents. The numbered prefixes help indicate the recommended import order.
*   **`tools/`**: This directory will house the Python files that define the tools our agents will use. Each file groups related tools for better organization.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: This file will list all necessary Python packages for the tools to function correctly.

## Step 2: Create the Tools
Tools are the building blocks that allow agents to perform actions. We will create a set of Python-based tools that simulate interactions with Global Logistics Inc.'s key systems. Each tool will generate realistic synthetic data to power the demo.

### 2.1. Shipment Data Tools (`tools/shipment_tools.py`)
These tools simulate interactions with a Transportation Management System (TMS). They are responsible for fetching and updating core shipment information, which is the first step in diagnosing any logistics issue. Their business value lies in providing immediate, on-demand access to critical logistics data without requiring users to navigate complex legacy systems.

```python
# tools/shipment_tools.py
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import random
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

# --- Synthetic Data Generation ---
def _generate_shipments():
    """Generates a list of realistic synthetic shipment data."""
    statuses = ["In Transit", "Customs Hold", "Delivered", "Delayed", "At Port"]
    shipments = []
    for i in range(1, 11):
        shipment_id = f"SHP-GL-{i:03d}"
        origin = random.choice(["Shanghai, CN", "Rotterdam, NL", "Los Angeles, US", "Singapore, SG"])
        destination = random.choice(["New York, US", "Hamburg, DE", "Dubai, AE", "Santos, BR"])
        # Ensure origin and destination are not the same
        while origin == destination:
            destination = random.choice(["New York, US", "Hamburg, DE", "Dubai, AE", "Santos, BR"])
            
        status = random.choice(statuses)
        details = {
            "SHP-GL-002": "Awaiting updated commercial invoice.",
            "SHP-GL-005": "Weather delay at origin port."
        }.get(shipment_id, "On schedule.")

        shipments.append({
            "shipment_id": shipment_id,
            "origin": origin,
            "destination": destination,
            "current_status": status,
            "status_details": details,
            "estimated_delivery": (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=random.randint(5, 25))).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            "carrier": "Oceanic Freight Masters"
        })
    return shipments

_shipment_database = _generate_shipments()

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_shipment_details(shipment_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves detailed information for a specific shipment using its unique shipment ID.

    This tool is essential for getting a real-time snapshot of a shipment's status, location, and other critical details.

    Args:
        shipment_id (str): The unique identifier for the shipment (e.g., 'SHP-GL-001').

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string containing the shipment details, or an error message if not found.
    """
    for shipment in _shipment_database:
        if shipment["shipment_id"] == shipment_id:
            return json.dumps(shipment)
    return json.dumps({"error": f"Shipment with ID '{shipment_id}' not found."})

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def get_shipment_history(shipment_id: str) -> str:
    """

    """
    if not any(s['shipment_id'] == shipment_id for s in _shipment_database):
        return json.dumps({"error": f"Shipment with ID '{shipment_id}' not found."})

    history = [
        {"timestamp": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=10)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), "event": "Shipment Created", "location": "Shanghai, CN"},
        {"timestamp": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=8)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), "event": "Departed Origin Port", "location": "Shanghai, CN"},
        {"timestamp": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=2)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), "event": "Arrived at Destination Port", "location": "Los Angeles, US"},
        {"timestamp": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), "event": "Held by Customs", "location": "Los Angeles, US", "details": "Missing Commercial Invoice"},
    ]
    return json.dumps(history)

@tool(permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def update_shipment_status(shipment_id: str, new_status: str, details: str) -> str:
    """

    Updates the status and details of a specific shipment.

    This tool allows the agent to take action, such as resolving a hold or updating the status after an issue is fixed.

        new_status (str): The new status to set for the shipment (e.g., 'In Transit', 'Customs Cleared').
        details (str): A description of the reason for the status update.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON string confirming the update or returning an error.
    """
    for shipment in _shipment_database:
        if shipment["shipment_id"] == shipment_id:
            shipment["current_status"] = new_status
            shipment["status_details"] = details
            shipment["last_updated"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
            return json.dumps({"success": True, "updated_shipment": shipment})
    return json.dumps({"error": f"Shipment with ID '{shipment_id}' not found."})
```

### 2.2. Customs Compliance Tools (`tools/customs_tools.py`)
These tools simulate interactions with a customs brokerage API. They are vital for resolving issues related to international trade compliance, a common source of shipment delays. The business value is in accelerating customs clearance by automating document checks and generation, reducing the risk of costly penalties and delays
