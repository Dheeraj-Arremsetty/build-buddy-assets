### **Demo Presentation Script: Building New Revenue Streams with IBM watsonx Orchestrate**

**Presenter:** IBM watsonx Orchestrate Specialist
**Audience:** Xerox Business Development, Product Strategy, and IT Services Leadership
**Time Allotment:** 20 Minutes

---

### **Part 1: Setting the Stage & Aligning on the Opportunity (5 Minutes)**

**(0:00 - 2:00) | Opening & Company Context**

**Talking Points:**

*   "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a specialist with the IBM watsonx Orchestrate team."
*   "We've been following Xerox's strategic direction closely, and we're genuinely impressed with your pivot towards integrated workplace services and your focus on strengthening your position in the SMB market."
*   "We've reviewed your latest reports and understand the dual challenge: consolidating your leadership in the core print market while aggressively building out new, high-margin digital and IT service revenue streams. Your focus on 'applied AI' through initiatives like the Agent Builder is exactly where the market is heading."
*   "Today, I'm not here to give you a generic platform demo. I'm here to show you a tangible, market-ready solution that directly aligns with your strategy—a way to leverage watsonx Orchestrate to create a new, scalable, subscription-based service for your SMB clients, today."

**(2:00 - 5:00) | The Problem & The Xerox Opportunity**

**Key Message:** Frame the problem from the perspective of Xerox's SMB customers, creating a clear market opportunity that Xerox is uniquely positioned to capture.

**Talking Points:**

*   "Let's talk about your SMB clients. They face a significant IT support gap. They need enterprise-grade support to stay productive, but they lack the budget and headcount for a dedicated, 24/7 IT help desk."
*   "What does this lead to? Employee downtime, frustration, and productivity loss. Common issues like password resets, software access, and network problems can halt a small business in its tracks. IT staff, if they even have them, are buried in repetitive, low-value tasks."
*   "This is where Xerox comes in. You already have the relationships, the brand trust, and the channel to reach these customers. The missing piece has been a scalable, cost-effective technology platform to deliver this service."
*   **The Value Proposition:** "We propose an **AI-Powered IT Help Desk Assistant**, built on watsonx Orchestrate. This isn't just a chatbot; it's a digital workforce that you can brand, package, and sell as a high-value subscription service. It directly addresses your customers' pain points while creating a new, predictable, high-margin revenue stream for Xerox."

### **Part 2: The Solution in Action - Live Demonstration (8 Minutes)**

**Key Message:** Showcase the intelligence, versatility, and business value of the solution by running through the three pre-defined scenarios. Emphasize the seamless orchestration happening behind the scenes.

**(5:00 - 6:00) | Introducing the Digital Workforce**

**Talking Points:**

*   "What you're about to see is a proof-of-concept we built based on your use case. It's a multi-agent system designed using what we call a 'Supervisor-Collaborator' pattern."
*   "There is one main agent—the **IT Help Desk Supervisor**—that the employee interacts with. Its only job is to understand the user's intent and delegate the task to the right specialist."
*   "Behind the supervisor, we have a team of three specialist agents:"
    1.  **User Access Agent:** Handles password resets and account unlocks.
    2.  **Software Provisioning Agent:** Manages software requests and license checks.
    3.  **Network Troubleshooter Agent:** Answers questions using a knowledge base of your company's IT documents.
*   "Let's see this digital team in action. I'm now in the watsonx Orchestrate chat, interacting with our IT Help Desk Supervisor."

**(6:00 - 8:30) | Demo Scenario 1: The High-Frequency Fix (Password Reset)**

*   **Presenter Action:** Type the user's request into the chat interface.
*   **User Input:** `I'm locked out of my account, my email is jane.doe@smb-client.com.`

**Talking Points (while the agent is working):**

*   "This is one of the most common tickets any help desk receives. It's a productivity killer for the employee and a repetitive time-sink for IT."
*   "Right now, the Supervisor agent has received this request. It recognized the keywords 'locked out' and immediately routed the task to the **User Access Agent**."
*   "That specialist agent is now securely executing a tool—a Python script in this case—that interacts with a mock user directory to unlock the account and generate a temporary password."

*   **Presenter Action:** Point to the screen as the result appears.
*   **Expected AI Output:** `Password for jane.doe@smb-client.com has been successfully reset. The temporary password is: [Generated Password]. Please change it upon first login.`

**Business Value Highlight:**

*   "And there it is. In seconds, the issue is resolved. No ticket created, no human intervention required. For your SMB client, that's immediate employee uptime. For Xerox, that's a task handled with zero marginal cost."

**(8:30 - 10:30) | Demo Scenario 2: The Controlled Process (Software Request)**

*   **Presenter Action:** Type the next user request.
*   **User Input:** `I need to install Microsoft Visio.`

**Talking Points:**

*   "Now for a more complex request. Software licensing is a major cost center for SMBs. You can't just give it to everyone."
*   "The Supervisor agent sees 'install' and 'Visio' and routes this to the **Software Provisioning Agent**."
*   "Notice the intelligence here. The agent knows it needs more information to proceed. Its instructions tell it to ask for the user's email before it can do anything."

*   **Expected AI Output:** `I can help with that. What is your email address?`
*   **Presenter Action:** Provide the email.
*   **User Input:** `My email is john.smith@smb-client.com`

**Talking Points (while the agent is working):**

*   "Now the agent has what it needs. It's executing a two-step process defined in its instructions: first, it calls a tool to check a software catalog to see if a license is available. In our mock data, there is one license left. Because it's available, it proceeds to the second step: calling another tool to simulate creating a support ticket for the installation."

*   **Presenter Action:** Point to the final result.
*   **Expected AI Output:** `Request approved. A support ticket (INC12345) has been created to install Microsoft Visio for john.smith@smb-client.com. The IT team will be in touch shortly.`

**Business Value Highlight:**

*   "This demonstrates automated governance. You're providing a fast, self-service experience while ensuring your clients don't have license overspending. This adds immense value beyond simple task automation."

**(10:30 - 13:00) | Demo Scenario 3: The Knowledge Worker (Network Troubleshooting with RAG)**

*   **Presenter Action:** Type the final user request.
*   **User Input:** `My laptop won't connect to the office Wi-Fi.`

**Talking Points:**

*   "Our final scenario showcases a completely different capability. What if the answer isn't in an API call, but buried in a standard operating procedure document?"
*   "The Supervisor routes this to the **Network Troubleshooter Agent**. This agent has no custom tools. Instead, it's connected to a knowledge base containing your IT support guides—simple text files in our case."
*   "It's now performing what we call Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG. It searches the documents for the most relevant information and then uses a large language model to synthesize a clear, conversational answer for the user."

*   **Presenter Action:** Point to the screen.
*   **Expected AI Output:** `I can help with that. If you are unable to connect to the "SMB-Office-WIFI" network, please try these steps: First, "forget" the network from your device's Wi-Fi settings. Then, try to reconnect and enter the password "SecurePassword123!" when prompted. If that doesn't work, please let me know.`

**Business Value Highlight:**

*   "You just turned your static documentation into an interactive expert. This empowers employees to solve their own problems, drastically reducing the number of simple, repetitive support tickets. You can load this with any documentation your clients have."

### **Part 3: Business Impact and Next Steps (7 Minutes)**

**(13:00 - 15:00) | Tying it all Together: The Xerox Value Proposition**

**Key Message:** Connect the demo directly back to Xerox's strategic goals and the financial benefits.

**Talking Points:**

*   "So, in just a few minutes, we've seen a digital workforce handle three very different IT tasks, all orchestrated by a single supervisor."
*   "What does this mean for Xerox?
    *   **New, High-Margin Revenue:** You can package this as a tiered subscription service for your SMB base. This is a predictable, recurring revenue stream that moves you further into the services space.
    *   **Increased Customer Stickiness:** By solving a critical operational pain point, you embed Xerox deeper into your clients' daily business, making your relationship about more than just hardware.
    *   **Rapid Time-to-Market:** This isn't a multi-year development project. Using the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit, your teams can build, test, and deploy agents like these in a matter of weeks, not quarters.
    *   **Competitive Differentiation:** While competitors are talking about AI, you can deliver a practical, applied AI solution that provides immediate ROI to your customers."

**(15:00 - 17:00) | A Glimpse Under the Hood: How It's Built**

**Key Message:** Briefly show the simplicity and power of the development tools to build confidence with technical stakeholders.

**Talking Points:**

*   "I want to quickly show you how this is built, because the simplicity is key to your speed to market."
*   **(Show YAML File):** "Each agent is defined in a simple YAML file. Here you can see the `IT_Help_Desk_Supervisor`. Its instructions are in plain English, and you can see where we've listed its collaborators—the specialist agents."
*   **(Show Python Tool):** "The 'skills' or 'tools' are just simple Python functions. This is the `reset_user_password` function. The `@tool` decorator and the docstring are all it takes for Orchestrate to understand what this tool does, what inputs it needs, and what it returns. This makes it incredibly easy to connect to any system with an API—ServiceNow, Jira, or your clients' internal systems."
*   **(Show Knowledge Base File):** "And finally, this is the knowledge base definition. We simply point it to the document files. The platform handles the ingestion, vectorization, and search automatically."

**(17:00 - 20:00) | Q&A and Next Steps**

**Prepared Q&A Scenarios:**

*   **Q: How secure is this? Can we control what the agents do?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely. Security is paramount. As you saw in the Python code, tools can be assigned permissions, like `ADMIN` only. All interactions are logged, and you have full control over what APIs the tools can access. The platform runs on IBM Cloud, inheriting its enterprise-grade security.

*   **Q: How does this integrate with our clients' existing systems, like Active Directory or their ticketing system?**
    *   **A:** The tools are the integration points. Since they are Python-based, they can use standard libraries to connect to virtually any API. For Active Directory, you'd use a library to make secure LDAP calls. For ServiceNow, you'd make REST API calls. This is designed for extensibility.

*   **Q: How customizable is this? Can we build agents for other domains, like HR or Finance?**
    *   **A:** That's the core value. The framework is completely domain-agnostic. You could use the exact same Supervisor/Collaborator pattern to build an HR Assistant that handles vacation requests and benefits questions, or a Finance Assistant for expense report queries. This is a factory for building digital workers.

*   **Q: What is the pricing model? How do we build a profitable service on this?**
    *   **A:** The Orchestrate pricing model is designed for this type of value-added service. It's based on platform usage, allowing you to build your subscription pricing on top with a healthy margin. We can schedule a dedicated session to model the specific business case for your SMB service offering.

**Call to Action:**

*   "What we've shown you is more than a concept; it's an executable plan. The next step is to make this real for Xerox."
*   "We'd like to propose a two-day, hands-on workshop with your technical and product teams. We will bring our experts and, using the ADK, we will build this exact IT Help Desk POC live with your team, connected to one of your test systems."
*   "This will give you the direct experience needed to validate the platform's capabilities and map out a clear path to production. How does your calendar look next week to schedule that session?"
