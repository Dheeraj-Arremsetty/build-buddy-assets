# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan: "Empower" Agent for Employee Success

## Overview

This execution plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building a powerful demonstration for your client using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. The demo centers on the "Empower" agent, a sophisticated digital assistant designed to streamline and enhance the employee experience. By integrating Human Resources (HR), IT support, and benefits management, the Empower agent acts as a single point of contact for employees, intelligently routing requests, automating tasks, and providing instant access to information.

The architecture follows a supervisor-collaborator model. The primary `empower_agent` functions as a supervisor, analyzing employee requests and delegating tasks to specialized collaborator agents: the `customer_care_agent` for handling healthcare and benefits inquiries, and the `service_now_agent` for managing IT service incidents. This layered approach demonstrates Orchestrate's advanced reasoning and workflow automation capabilities, showcasing how it can connect disparate enterprise systems to create a seamless, efficient, and user-centric solution that directly addresses the client's need for improved operational efficiency and employee support.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your development environment is properly configured. This is crucial for a smooth implementation and successful demo.

1.  **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) must be installed. This is the core toolkit for building, testing, and deploying agents and tools.
    ```bash
    pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-adk
    ```
2.  **Orchestrate Environment**: You must have an active watsonx Orchestrate environment initialized. This connects your local ADK to your Orchestrate instance. If you haven't already, run:
    ```bash
    orchestrate login
    orchestrate env init
    ```
3.  **Python 3.9+**: A modern version of Python is required to create the custom tools.
4.  **Project Structure**: Create the following directory structure to organize your files. This plan will assume this structure is in place.

    ```
    empower_demo/
    ├── agents/
    │   ├── customer_care_agent.yaml
    │   ├── service_now_agent.yaml
    │   └── empower_agent.yaml

    ```

## Step 1: Create the Python Tools

Tools are the building blocks of an agent's capabilities, allowing it to interact with systems and perform actions. We will create six distinct tools, divided into two domains: Customer Care (for HR/benefits) and ServiceNow (for IT support). Each tool will generate realistic synthetic data to simulate interactions with live enterprise systems.

### 1.1 Customer Care Tools

These tools simulate interactions with a healthcare benefits and provider system.

#### `get_healthcare_benefits.py`

**Business Value**: This tool provides immediate, on-demand access to detailed health plan information. It eliminates the need for employees to search through complex documents or contact HR for common questions, thereby improving employee self-service and reducing the burden on HR staff. It empowers employees to make informed decisions about their healthcare.

**Technical Implementation**: The Python function uses the `@tool` decorator to register it with Orchestrate. It takes a health plan type as input and returns a structured list of dictionaries containing benefits information. We use the `requests` library to simulate fetching data from an external API endpoint.

```python
# empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_healthcare_benefits.py

from enum import Enum
import requests
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool

class Plan(str, Enum):
    HDHP = 'HDHP'
    HDHP_Plus = 'HDHP Plus'
    PPO = 'PPO'

@tool
def get_healthcare_benefits(plan: Plan, in_network: bool = None):
    """Retrieves a comprehensive list of health benefits data, organized by coverage type and plan variant.

    This data includes details such as annual deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and various co-pays or
    percentages for medical services under different network plans (HDHP, HDHP Plus, and PPO).

    Args:
        plan (str, optional): The plan the user is currently on. Can be one of "HDHP", "HDHP Plus", or "PPO".
            If not provided, all plans will be returned.
        in_network (bool, optional): Whether the user wants coverage for in-network or out-of-network.
            If not provided, both will be returned.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains benefit details.
    """
    # In a real scenario, this would call a live API. We are using a mock service.
    try:
        resp = requests.get(
            'https://get-benefits-data.1sqnxi8zv3dh.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/',
            params={
                'plan': plan,
                'in_network': in_network
            }
        )
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return resp.json()['benefits']
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return {"error": f"Failed to retrieve healthcare benefits: {str(e)}"}

```

#### `get_my_claims.py`

**Business Value**: This tool offers employees instant visibility into the status of their medical claims. It reduces anxiety and uncertainty associated with the claims process and decreases the volume of status inquiries directed to the benefits administration team, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.

**Technical Implementation**: This function generates a static list of synthetic claim data, including various statuses (`Processed`, `Pending`, `Rejected`) to showcase how the agent can handle different scenarios. It returns a list of dictionaries, each representing a detailed claim.

```python
# empower_demo/tools/customer_care/get_my_claims.py

from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import random

@tool
def get_my_claims() -> list[dict]:
    """Retrieves detailed information about the current user's submitted medical claims.

    The details include claim status, submission and processing dates, amounts claimed and approved,
    provider information, and services included in the claims.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of dictionaries, each containing details about a specific claim.
    """
    # Synthetic data generation for a realistic demo
    claims_data = [
        {
            "claimId": "CLM1234567",
            "submittedDate": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=45)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            "claimStatus": "Processed",
            "processedDate": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            "amountClaimed": 150.00,
            "amountApproved": 120.00,
            "rejectionReason": None,
            "provider": { "name": "Healthcare Clinic ABC", "providerId": "PRV001234" },
            "services": [ { "description": "General Consultation", "dateOfService": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=47)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), "amount": 150.00 } ]
        },
        {
            "claimId": "CLM7654321",
            "submittedDate": (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=14)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
