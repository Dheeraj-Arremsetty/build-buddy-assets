## Demo Presentation Script: Xerox Sales Co-pilot

**Title:** Accelerating Xerox's Services-Led Future: The AI Sales Co-pilot powered by IBM watsonx Orchestrate
**Presenter:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Audience:** Xerox Sales Leadership, IT & Digital Transformation Stakeholders
**Time Allotment:** 20 minutes

---

### **Part 1: Setting the Stage - The Strategic Imperative (3 minutes)**

**(Objective: Align with Xerox's strategic goals and establish IBM as a knowledgeable partner.)**

**[SLIDE 1: Title Slide - "Accelerating Xerox's Services-Led Future" with Xerox and IBM watsonx Orchestrate logos]**

**Presenter Talking Points:**

*   "Good morning/afternoon. We're excited to be here today. We've done our research, and we understand that Xerox is at a pivotal moment—navigating a critical transition from a legacy leader in print to a modern, services-led digital intelligence provider."
*   "Your own annual report highlights this challenge: your core print business is stable but flat, and future growth is squarely in digital services, workflow automation, and AI."
*   "This strategic pivot puts immense pressure on your sales organization. They are no longer just selling hardware; they are selling complex, multi-faceted solutions like Managed Print Services, IT Outsourcing, and Digital Transformation consulting."
*   "The challenge is that selling these complex solutions requires a very different, and often much slower, sales process. Today, we're going to focus on a major bottleneck in that process—proposal and contract generation—and show you how AI can transform it into a competitive advantage."

**[SLIDE 2: The Challenge - "The High Cost of Manual Sales Processes"]**

**Presenter Talking Points:**

*   "Let's consider a day in the life of one of your top enterprise sales reps. They've just had a great discovery call with a potential client, 'Global Tech Inc.', for a Managed Print Services deal."
*   "Now, the hard work begins. They need to create a detailed, accurate, and compelling proposal. What does that look like today?"
    *   **First, they log into Salesforce** to pull the client’s address, contact details, and account history.
    *   **Next, they search internal knowledge bases**—maybe SharePoint or a shared drive—for the latest service descriptions, pricing tiers, and standard terms for MPS. Is it the most up-to-date version? They hope so.
    *   **Then, they open a proposal template** and manually copy-paste all this information, trying to format it correctly.
    *   **This entire process can take hours**, sometimes even days, for a complex deal. It's time spent on administrative work, not on building client relationships or finding the next opportunity."
*   **"This manual process isn't just slow; it's risky.** It leads to inconsistencies, potential errors in pricing or terms, and ultimately, a slower sales cycle that directly impacts your ability to accelerate your services-led revenue growth."

### **Part 2: The Solution - Introducing the Xerox Sales Co-pilot (2 minutes)**

**(Objective: Introduce watsonx Orchestrate as the solution, framing it as a digital teammate.)**

**[SLIDE 3: The Solution - "The AI Sales Co-pilot: Your Digital Teammate"]**

**Presenter Talking Points:**

*   "Imagine if you could give every salesperson a digital teammate—an AI co-pilot that handles all of that administrative work instantly. That's exactly what we've built for you today using IBM watsonx Orchestrate."
*   "The **Xerox Sales Co-pilot** is a conversational AI agent designed to automate the entire proposal generation workflow. It connects to your systems, understands your offerings, and acts on your sales team's natural language requests."
*   "In the next few minutes, we're going to show you this co-pilot in action. You'll see how it can:"
    1.  **Integrate Seamlessly:** Pulling live data from systems like Salesforce.
    2.  **Retrieve Accurately:** Finding and using the correct service information from your internal knowledge base.
    3.  **Orchestrate Intelligently:** Managing complex, multi-step tasks to generate a complete document in seconds.
*   "Let's move to the live demonstration."

### **Part 3: Live Demonstration (8 minutes)**

**(Objective: Showcase the solution's capabilities and intelligence through concrete, relatable scenarios.)**

**[Presenter switches to the watsonx Orchestrate chat interface, with the "Xerox_Sales_Co-pilot" selected.]**

**Presenter Talking Points:**

*   "This is the watsonx Orchestrate interface. It's as simple as using any chat application. Our salesperson can now interact directly with their AI co-pilot."

**Scenario 1: Standard Proposal Generation (The Happy Path)**

*   **Presenter:** "Let's start with that deal for Global Tech Inc. Our salesperson simply types a request."
*   **Action:** Presenter types the following prompt into the chat:
    > **"Draft a proposal for 'Global Tech Inc.' for your Managed Print Services."**
*   **Narration (while the agent is working):** "Right now, the Sales Co-pilot is kicking off a multi-step process.
    *   First, it understands the request requires customer data. It intelligently delegates this task to a specialist agent, our **Salesforce Data Agent**, which is now calling our mock Salesforce API to retrieve Global Tech's details.
    *   Now that it has the customer data, it passes that information to another specialist, the **Proposal Generation Agent**.
    *   This agent is performing a semantic search across your service catalog—our knowledge base—to find the specific details for 'Managed Print Services'. This is Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, ensuring the information is accurate and grounded in your approved content.
    *   Finally, it's using a custom tool to assemble all of this information into a perfectly formatted proposal."
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent returns a complete, formatted proposal in the chat.
*   **Presenter:** "And there we have it. In about 15 seconds, we have a complete draft. **[Highlights sections on screen]** You can see the customer name and address pulled directly from Salesforce, and the detailed service description, features, and pricing for MPS pulled directly from our knowledge base. What used to take hours now takes seconds."

**Scenario 2: Handling Complexity & Multiple Services**

*   **Presenter:** "But what about more complex, multi-service deals? That's where the real power of orchestration comes in. Let's try another one."
*   **Action:** Presenter types:
    > **"Create a contract for 'Innovate Solutions' that includes both IT Outsourcing and Digital Transformation Services."**
*   **Narration:** "Again, the same process kicks off. It's getting the customer data for Innovate Solutions. But this time, the Proposal Agent is smart enough to search the knowledge base for *two distinct services*, synthesize the information, and combine it into a single, coherent document."
*   **Expected Outcome:** A longer proposal is generated, containing sections for both IT Outsourcing and Digital Transformation Services.
*   **Presenter:** "As you can see, the co-pilot didn't get confused. It seamlessly combined the details for both services, pulling the correct terms and capabilities for each. This ensures consistency and quality, even for your most complex, high-value deals."

**Scenario 3: Conversational Intelligence & Clarification**

*   **Presenter:** "Finally, a great assistant knows when to ask for more information. What if the salesperson's request is vague?"
*   **Action:** Presenter types:
    > **"I need a proposal for 'Creative Designs'."**
*   **Narration:** "Watch what happens now. The master agent recognizes that a critical piece of information is missing—the service offering. Instead of failing or guessing, it uses its reasoning instructions to engage in a conversation."
*   **Expected Outcome:** The agent responds with a clarifying question.
    > *"I can help with that. Which Xerox services are you proposing for Creative Designs?"*
*   **Presenter:** "This is a crucial point. This isn't just a simple script; it's an intelligent agent that can reason, understand context, and collaborate with the user to get the job done right. This significantly reduces errors and ensures the final output is exactly what the salesperson needs."

### **Part 4: How It Works & The Business Value (5 minutes)**

**(Objective: Briefly explain the underlying technology and tie the demo directly to tangible business outcomes and ROI.)**

**[SLIDE 4: How It Works - "Intelligent Orchestration in Action"]**

**Presenter Talking Points:**

*   "What you just saw was a sophisticated, multi-agent system at work, built easily with our Agent Development Kit."
*   **"Think of it like a highly efficient team:**
    *   The **Xerox Sales Co-pilot** is the **Manager**. It doesn't do the work itself; it understands the overall goal and delegates tasks.
    *   The **Salesforce Agent** is your **CRM Specialist**. Its only job is to get data from Salesforce.
    *   The **Proposal Agent** is your **Content Expert**. It knows how to find service information in your knowledge base and draft documents."
*   "This architecture, powered by IBM watsonx, allows you to build powerful, scalable AI solutions that are:"
    *   **Grounded in Your Data:** Using your service catalogs and knowledge bases (RAG) to prevent hallucinations and ensure accuracy.
    *   **Integrated with Your Systems:** Connecting to any application with an API, like Salesforce, SAP, or ServiceNow.
    *   **Customizable and Secure:** Built to reflect your unique business logic and run within your trusted enterprise environment.

**[SLIDE 5: The ROI - "Transforming Sales Productivity & Accelerating Growth"]**

**Presenter Talking Points:**

*   "So, what does this mean for Xerox's bottom line?"
*   **Increase Sales Velocity:** "By reducing proposal generation time from hours to seconds, you shorten the entire sales cycle. More deals, faster."
*   **Boost Seller Productivity:** "We're giving hours back to every salesperson, every week. This is time they can reinvest in high-value activities: prospecting, nurturing relationships, and closing deals. This directly addresses the challenge of growing your services business without dramatically increasing headcount."
*   **Ensure Quality & Compliance:** "Proposals are always generated using the latest, approved information. This eliminates embarrassing errors and reduces compliance risk."
*   **Scale Your Expertise:** "Your best practices for proposal creation are now embedded in the AI. This allows you to onboard new sales reps faster and ensures a consistent, high-quality experience for all your customers."

### **Part 5: Q&A and Next Steps (2 minutes)**

**(Objective: Address potential questions and define a clear call to action.)**

**Presenter:** "I'll pause here and open it up for any questions you may have."

**Prepared Q&A Scenarios:**

*   **Q: How secure is this? We can't have our customer or service data exposed.**
    *   **A:** "Security is paramount. watsonx Orchestrate is an enterprise-grade platform. The RAG pattern means the agent is grounded in *your* private, controlled documents. We can deploy using IBM's trusted models or even your own, ensuring your data stays within your secure environment."
*   **Q: This demo used a mock API. How difficult is it to connect to our real Salesforce instance and other internal systems?**
    *   **A:** "It's very straightforward. Orchestrate uses industry-standard OpenAPI specifications. If your system has a REST API, we can connect to it. We can also build custom Python tools for more complex logic, giving you the flexibility to integrate with virtually any part of your tech stack."
*   **Q: How much effort is required to build and maintain an agent like this?**
    *   **A:** "That's the power of our Agent Development Kit. We define the agents, tools, and knowledge bases in simple, readable configuration files. This low-code approach means you can build and iterate on these solutions much faster than traditional development, empowering your teams to solve their own business problems."
*   **Q: How do we prevent the AI from "hallucinating" or making things up?**
    *   **A:** "This is where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is key. The Proposal Agent isn't creating service descriptions from memory; it is explicitly instructed to *find* the information in the Xerox Service Catalog you provide. It retrieves and presents facts, it doesn't invent them. This grounds the AI in reality and ensures accuracy."

**[SLIDE 6: Next Steps]**

**Presenter Talking Points:**

*   "Thank you for your time today. We've shown how a custom AI Sales Co-pilot can directly address your strategic goal of accelerating services-led growth by transforming a key sales bottleneck."
*   "Our recommended next step is a **2-hour Discovery Workshop**. In this session, we'll work with your sales and IT teams to map out this proposal generation use case in detail and identify 1-2 other high-impact automation opportunities where watsonx Orchestrate can deliver significant value."
*   "We'll follow up to schedule that session. We're excited about the potential to partner with Xerox on your digital transformation journey."
