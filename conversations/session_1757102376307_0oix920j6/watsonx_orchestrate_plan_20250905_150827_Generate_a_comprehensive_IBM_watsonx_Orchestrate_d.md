## Execution Plan

# IBM watsonx Orchestrate Execution Plan

## Overview
This execution plan outlines the development and deployment of an automated ESG Intelligence & Reporting Workflow using IBM watsonx Orchestrate for S&P Global. The solution aims to transform ESG data extraction, analysis, and reporting processes by leveraging multi-agent systems. By automating these tasks, the solution reduces manual processing time from 2 hours to 15 minutes per company, enhances accuracy in ESG metric extraction, and supports S&P Global's leadership in ESG intelligence.

## Prerequisites
- **IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK**: Ensure the latest version is installed for agent and tool development.
- **Python 3.8+**: Required to develop custom tools and run Python-based scripts.
- **Document Management System**: A system to store and manage synthetic ESG data.
- **Network Access**: Ensure connectivity to IBM watsonx Orchestrate services and external APIs.
- **Synthetic Data**: Prepare mock data, including ESG reports, social media sentiment data, and regulatory filings, for testing and demonstration.

## Step 1: Create YAML Configuration

### Data Ingestion Agent
The Data Ingestion Agent automates the collection of sustainability reports and social media sentiment, initiating the ESG workflow.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: data_ingestion_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: react
description: >
    Automates the collection of quarterly sustainability reports and social media sentiment data to feed into ESG analysis.
instructions: >
    Use report_downloader to gather sustainability reports. Use sentiment_collector to analyze social media sentiment.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - report_downloader
  - sentiment_collector
```

### ESG Intelligence Agent
The ESG Intelligence Agent processes and analyzes ESG metrics, comparing trends and flagging material changes.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: esg_intelligence_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: planner
description: >
    Analyzes ESG metrics to detect trends and identify significant changes in company performance.
instructions: >
    Use esg_metric_extractor for extracting ESG metrics. Use trend_analyzer to identify significant trends or changes.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - esg_metric_extractor
  - trend_analyzer
```

### Reporting & Alerting Agent
This agent is responsible for generating ESG scorecards, sector-level reports, and client alerts.

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: reporting_alerting_agent
llm: watsonx/ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct
style: default
description: >
    Generates comprehensive ESG scorecards, sector-level reports, and sends alerts for significant ESG changes.
instructions: >
    Use scorecard_generator to create ESG reports. Use alert_notifier to send alerts on significant ESG changes.
collaborators: []
tools:
  - scorecard_generator
  - alert_notifier
```

## Step 2: Create Tools

### report_downloader Tool
Automates downloading of quarterly sustainability reports, making them available for analysis.

```python
from ibm_watsonx_orchestrate.agent_builder.tools import tool, ToolPermission

@tool(name="report_downloader", description="Downloads sustainability reports", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def download_reports(company_id: str) -> dict:
    """Downloads quarterly sustainability reports for a given company ID.

    Args:
        company_id (str): The unique identifier for the company.

    Returns:
        dict: Contains status and path of the downloaded report.
    """
    # Mock download logic
    return {"status": "success", "path": f"/reports/{company_id}/latest.pdf"}
```

### sentiment_collector Tool
Collects and analyzes social media sentiment data related to ESG issues.

```python
@tool(name="sentiment_collector", description="Analyzes social media sentiment", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def collect_sentiment_data(company_id: str) -> dict:
    """Collects and analyzes social media sentiment for ESG controversies.

    Args:
        company_id (str): The unique identifier for the company.

    Returns:
        dict: Sentiment analysis results.
    """
    # Mock sentiment analysis logic
    return {"sentiment_score": 0.85, "status": "positive"}
```

### esg_metric_extractor Tool
Extracts ESG metrics from sustainability reports to support analysis.

```python
@tool(name="esg_metric_extractor", description="Extracts ESG metrics", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def extract_metrics(report_path: str) -> dict:
    """Extracts ESG metrics from the given report.

    Args:
        report_path (str): The file path to the report.

    Returns:
        dict: Extracted ESG metrics.
    """
    # Mock extraction logic
    return {"carbon_footprint": 200, "water_usage": 1000}
```

### trend_analyzer Tool
Analyzes ESG metric trends to identify and flag significant changes.

```python
@tool(name="trend_analyzer", description="Analyzes ESG trends", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def analyze_trends(metrics: dict) -> dict:
    """Analyzes ESG metric trends and flags significant changes.

    Args:
        metrics (dict): The ESG metrics data.

    Returns:
        dict: Trends analysis results.
    """
    # Mock trend analysis logic
    return {"material_change": True, "trends": {"carbon_footprint": "increasing"}}
```

### scorecard_generator Tool
Generates detailed ESG scorecards based on analyzed metrics.

```python
@tool(name="scorecard_generator", description="Generates ESG scorecards", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def generate_scorecard(metrics: dict) -> dict:
    """Generates an ESG scorecard based on metrics.

    Args:
        metrics (dict): The ESG metrics data.

    Returns:
        dict: Generated scorecard.
    """
    # Mock scorecard generation logic
    return {"scorecard": {"overall_score": 85}}
```

### alert_notifier Tool
Sends alerts to stakeholders when significant ESG changes are detected.

```python
@tool(name="alert_notifier", description="Sends alerts for ESG changes", permission=ToolPermission.ADMIN)
def send_alerts(change: dict) -> dict:
    """Sends alerts for significant ESG changes.

    Args:
        change (dict): Details of the material change.

    Returns:
        dict: Alert status.
    """
    # Mock alert sending logic
    return {"alert_status": "sent", "recipient": "client@example.com"}
```

## Step 3: Import Tools and Agents

### Import Tools
To ensure the tools are available for use by the agents, import them using the following commands:

```bash
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/report_downloader.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/sentiment_collector.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/esg_metric_extractor.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/trend_analyzer.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/scorecard_generator.py
orchestrate tools import -k python -f tools/alert_notifier.py
```

### Import Agents
Import the agents to the IBM watsonx Orchestrate platform:

```bash
orchestrate agents import -f agents/data_ingestion_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f agents/esg_intelligence_agent.yaml
orchestrate agents import -f agents/reporting_alerting_agent.yaml
```

## Verification
- **Functionality Testing**: Test each agent and tool using synthetic data to validate their performance and accuracy.
- **Integration Testing**: Verify the end-to-end workflow, ensuring seamless data collection, processing, analysis, and alerting.
- **Performance Testing**: Assess the processing time against the target of reducing it to 15 minutes per company.

## Troubleshooting
- **Tool Import Errors**: Ensure the Python script paths and syntax are correct.
- **Agent Behavior Issues**: Verify YAML configurations and ensure correct tool references.
- **Data Handling**: Confirm that synthetic data matches expected formats and structures.

## Best Practices
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in all tools for unexpected data formats or network issues.
- **Data Validation**: Validate all inputs to maintain data integrity.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for each component to facilitate maintenance and updates.
- **Compliance**: Review workflows regularly to ensure alignment with ESG reporting standards and regulations.

By following this comprehensive execution plan, S&P Global will be able to efficiently deploy a robust ESG reporting solution that enhances data accuracy and reduces processing time, thereby maintaining their leadership in ESG intelligence.
