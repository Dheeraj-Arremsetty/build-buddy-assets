### Step 2: Create the Python Tools

Next, we will develop the Python-based tools that our HR and IT agents will use to perform actions. These tools will simulate interactions with real enterprise systems by using realistic synthetic data.

#### A. HRIS Tools

**Business Value:** These tools automate the retrieval and management of employee data, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual data entry errors. They form the backbone of the HR onboarding process.

**Technical Implementation:** The `hris_tools.py` file contains three functions decorated with `@tool`. Each function simulates an HRIS action: fetching new hire data, checking their onboarding task status, and updating their profile. The data is hardcoded for demo purposes but structured to mimic a real API response.

Create the file `tools/hris_tools.py`:
