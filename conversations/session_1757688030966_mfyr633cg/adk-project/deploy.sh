#!/bin/bash
# Generated deployment script

# Script block 1
pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate==1.7.0
   ```

2. **Python Environment**: Set up Python 3.9 or later with a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. This ensures compatibility with all required libraries and prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your system.
   ```bash
   python -m venv starbucks-wxo-env
   source starbucks-wxo-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: starbucks-wxo-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Required Python Packages**: Install all necessary dependencies for the Starbucks-specific tools. These packages enable data processing, API interactions, and synthetic data generation capabilities.
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas numpy python-dotenv pytz timezonefinder opencv-python
   ```

4. **Directory Structure**: Create an organized project structure to maintain all components. This structure facilitates easy navigation and management of the various agents, tools, and knowledge bases.
   ```bash
   mkdir -p starbucks-operations/{agents,tools,knowledge-bases,mock-data}
   cd starbucks-operations
   ```

5. **Environment Configuration**: Set up your watsonx Orchestrate environment with proper authentication. This involves configuring your API keys and endpoint URLs for both development and production environments.
   ```bash
   orchestrate environments init
   # Follow prompts to configure your environment
   ```

6. **Create requirements.txt**: Generate a requirements file for all Python dependencies needed by the tools. This ensures consistent environment setup across different deployment scenarios.
   ```bash
   cat > requirements.txt << EOF
   requests
   pandas
   numpy
   python-dotenv
   pytz
   timezonefinder
   opencv-python
   EOF
   ```

## Step 1: Create the Supervisor Agent Configuration

The Starbucks Operations Supervisor agent serves as the central orchestrator for all store operations, intelligently routing requests to specialized agents based on the nature of the task. This supervisor agent understands the context of partner requests and delegates to the appropriate specialized agent, whether it's for inventory management, scheduling, training, or equipment maintenance. By implementing a react-style architecture with comprehensive collaborator integration, this agent ensures seamless coordination across all operational domains while maintaining conversation context and providing proactive support for complex multi-step operations.

Create the file `agents/starbucks_operations_supervisor.yaml`:
