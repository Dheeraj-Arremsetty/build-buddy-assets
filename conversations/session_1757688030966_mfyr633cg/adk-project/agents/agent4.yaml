    The Partner Training & Support Agent is a comprehensive knowledge and training system that provides instant access to Starbucks policies, 
    procedures, recipes, and training materials. It serves both new partners during onboarding and experienced partners who need quick 
    reference to specific information. The agent uses advanced semantic search to understand natural language queries and provide relevant, 
    contextual responses from the extensive knowledge base of partner guides, recipe cards, and policy documents. It can generate 
    step-by-step instructions for any beverage, including modifications and dietary restrictions, while ensuring compliance with 
    Starbucks standards and food safety regulations.
