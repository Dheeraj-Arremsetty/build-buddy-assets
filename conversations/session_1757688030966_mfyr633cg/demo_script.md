## **SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM LANDSCAPE**
*[Duration: 3 minutes]*

### **The Day in the Life Story**
"Imagine Sarah, a shift supervisor at a busy downtown Starbucks. Her morning starts at 5:30 AM..."

### **Pain Points to Highlight:**
- **5:30 AM**: Checking inventory manually across 500+ SKUs
- **6:00 AM**: Discovering oat milk is critically low - the #1 requested milk alternative
- **6:30 AM**: Partner calls in sick, needs immediate coverage for morning rush
- **7:00 AM**: Espresso machine showing error codes during peak hours
- **8:00 AM**: New partner asking about drink recipes while line grows

### **Business Impact Points:**
- Lost revenue from stockouts: $2,000-3,000 per store per month
- Partner turnover costs: $3,500 per partner replacement
- Customer satisfaction scores drop 15% during operational disruptions
