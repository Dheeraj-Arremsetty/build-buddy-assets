```
User: "My printer shows error 016-799 and won't print"

Diagnostic Agent Response:
"I understand you're experiencing Error Code 016-799. This is a network connectivity issue. Let me help you resolve this quickly.

I've analyzed your device logs and found:
- Last successful connection: 2 hours ago
- Network timeout detected at 10:45 AM
- Device IP: 192.168.1.105

Here's your step-by-step solution:
1. Check if the network cable is properly connected
2. Verify your network settings (I can see your DHCP lease expired)
3. Restart the printer network module

Would you like me to guide you through each step?"
```
